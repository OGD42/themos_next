## **Visitor visa (temporary resident visa)**

A visitor visa (also called a temporary resident visa) is an official document that we stick in your passport. It shows that you meet the requirements needed to enter Canada.

## **Who needs a visitor visa**

**Most travelers need a visitor visa**

Most travelers need a visitor visa to travel to Canada. You may also need one if you’re [transiting through a Canadian airport](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/transit/about-transit-visa.html) on your way to your final destination.

A visitor visa (also called a temporary resident visa) is an official document that we put in your passport. It shows that you meet the requirements needed to travel to Canada.

**How long you can stay**

Most visitors can stay for up to 6 months in Canada.

At the port of entry, the border services officer may allow you to stay for less or more than 6 months. If so, they’ll put the date you need to leave by in your passport. They might also give you a document, called a [visitor record](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1452&top=16), which will show the date you need to leave by.

If you don’t get a stamp in your passport, you can stay for 6 months from the day you entered Canada or until your passport expires, whichever comes first. If you need a stamp, you can ask a border services officer for one. If you arrive at an airport that uses [primary inspection kiosks](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/services/border-tech-frontiere/pik-bip-eng.html), ask the border officer after you finish at the kiosk.

**Make sure you need a visitor visa before you apply**

You may need a visitor visa **or** an Electronic Travel Authorization. The entry document you need depends on:

- the type of travel document you plan to travel with
- the country that issued your travel document
- your nationality
- how you’ll travel to Canada for this trip

## **Who can apply**

**Who can get a visa**

You must meet some basic requirements to get a visitor visa.

You must:

- have a [valid travel document](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/passport-travel-document.html), like a passport
- be in good health
- have no criminal or immigration-related convictions
- convince an immigration officer that you have ties—such as a job, home, financial assets or family—that will take you back to your home country
- convince an immigration officer that you will leave Canada at the end of your visit
- have enough money for your stay
  - The amount of money you will need depends on how long you will stay and if you will stay in a hotel, or with friends or relatives.

You may also need a [medical exam](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams.html) and [letter of invitation](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/letter-invitation.html) from someone who lives in Canada.

Check the [list of documents you need based on your situation](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/apply-visitor-visa.html).

**Some people are not allowed to enter Canada**

Some people are inadmissible to Canada, which means they are not allowed to enter the country. You can be inadmissible for several reasons, including being involved in:

- criminal activity
- human rights violations
- organized crime

You can also be inadmissible for security, health or financial reasons. [Find out more about inadmissibility](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/inadmissibility.html).

**Situations where you may need extra documents on arrival**

If either of the following situations applies to you or someone you’ll travel with, have the documents indicated in hand.

**You have a child under the age of 18 (a minor child)**

[Find out more about minor children traveling to Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/minor-children-travelling-canada.html)

**You were invited to come to Canada**

If you got a letter from a person or company that invited you to Canada, bring that letter with you. A border services officer may ask to see it.

**Your arrival in Canada**

A valid visa and travel document don’t guarantee that you can enter Canada.

**We determine if you meet all entry requirements**

When you arrive, we’ll check your identity to make sure that you’re the same person who was approved to travel to Canada.

- **If you enter Canada at one of 4 major Canadian airports**
  - Your fingerprints will be checked automatically at a [primary inspection kiosk](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/services/border-tech-frontiere/pik-bip-eng.html).
  - The system will check your identity against the information collected when your application was submitted.
- **If you enter Canada at a land port of entry**
  - Your fingerprints may be checked if we refer you to a [secondary inspection](http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/pub/bsf5146-eng.html), where a border services officer will use a fingerprint verification device to check your fingerprints.

**When you enter Canada**

If you pass the identity check, health assessment, and meet the [entry requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/prepare-arrival.html#entry-requirements), the border services officer may stamp your passport or let you know how long you can stay in Canada. You’re [normally allowed to stay in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/prepare-arrival.html#stay-in-canada) for up to 6 months.

In some cases, the officer may limit or extend your time in Canada, depending on the purpose of your visit. Ask questions if you’re not sure about something.

You won’t be allowed into Canada if you give false or incomplete information. The officer must be convinced that

- you’re eligible for entry into Canada
- you’ll leave Canada at the end of your approved length of stay

&nbsp;

## **Electronic travel authorization**

Most travelers need a visa or an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) to fly to, or transit through, a Canadian airport.

**Before you apply**, [find out what you need](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/visit/visas.asp) to travel to Canada.

**What is an Electronic Travel Authorization?**

An Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) is an entry requirement for visa-exempt foreign nationals traveling to Canada by air. An eTA is electronically linked to a traveler’s passport. It is valid for **up to** five years or until the passport expires, whichever comes first. If you get a new passport, you need to get a new eTA.

With a valid eTA, you can travel to Canada as often as you want for short stays (normally for up to six months at a time). You do not need an eTA for travel within Canada.

An eTA doesn’t guarantee entry to Canada. When you arrive, a border services officer will ask to see your passport and other documents. You must convince the officer that you are [eligible for entry into Canada](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/visit/apply-eta-after.asp#basic).

**Who needs an eTA to travel to Canada?**

There are 4 types of travelers:

1. **Travelers who need an eTA:**
   - [Visa-exempt foreign nationals](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/entry-requirements-country.html) need an eTA to fly to or transit through a Canadian airport. These travelers do not need an eTA when arriving by car, bus, train or boat (including a cruise ship).
2. **Travelers who may be eligible to apply for an eTA:**
   - **Citizens from** [select visa-required countries](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eta/eligibility/eta-x.html) may be eligible to apply for an eTA, instead of a visa, to travel to Canada **by air**. However, these travelers need a [visitor visa](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/apply-visitor-visa.html) when arriving by car, bus, train, or boat, including a cruise ship.
3. **Travelers who cannot apply for an eTA and need to carry other identification:**
   - Canadian citizens, including dual citizens, need a [valid Canadian passport](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/dual-canadian-citizens-visit-canada.html). American-Canadians can travel with a valid Canadian or U.S. passport.
   - Canadian permanent residents need a valid [permanent resident card](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card/understand-pr-status.html) or [permanent resident travel document](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-travel-document.html).
     - **Important – former residents of Canada:** Permanent resident (PR) status does not expire. If you once lived in Canada **many years ago**, you could still have **PR status**. [Learn more to avoid travel delays](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card/understand-pr-status/am-i-pr.html).
   - [Visa-required](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/entry-requirements-country.html#visarequired) including alien’s passport holders and stateless individuals.
4. **Travelers who are exempt from the eTA requirement**.
   - U.S. citizens are exempt from the eTA requirement and must [carry proper identification](http://www.cbsa.gc.ca/travel-voyage/td-dv-eng.html) such as a valid U.S. passport.
   - Lawful permanent residents of the United States who hold valid status in the U.S. are exempt from the eTA requirement.
     - They must carry official proof of status (or an equivalent status document) and a valid passport from their country of nationality (or an equivalent travel document).
     - See the complete list of documents for lawful permanent residents of the U.S.

See the complete list of [eTA exceptions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/entry-requirements-country.html#eta-exemptions).

**How do I apply for an eTA for travel to Canada?**

**Only apply for an eTA on this official Government of Canada website.**

Applying for an eTA is a simple online process that takes just a few minutes to complete. Most applicants get their eTA approval (via an email) within minutes. However, some requests **can take several days** to process if you're asked to submit supporting documents. It is best to get an eTA **before** you book your flight to Canada.

An eTA costs CAD $7. You can only apply and pay for **one person at a time.**

To complete the form, you will need your passport, a credit card, and an email address. You must also answer a few questions.

**Avoid this common mistake when you apply**

If you enter the wrong passport number on the eTA form, you will have problems flying to Canada.

Use the [eTA help guide (PDF, 1.62 MB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/eta/english.pdf) and follow the instructions to enter your passport number correctly.

Use the number that is at the top of your passport information page – the page with your photo.

**What to bring to the airport**

When we approve your eTA, it will be **linked to the passport you used to apply**. You need to **present this passport when you check-in** to your flight to Canada.

The airline staff will scan your passport to confirm that you have a valid eTA. If you do not have one, you won’t be able to board your flight.

## **Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA): How to apply**

**What you need to complete the form and pay for your eTA**

You will need:

- a valid **passport** from a [visa-exempt country](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/visit/visas.asp)

As of April 26, 2022: Lawful permanent residents of the United States are exempt from the eTA requirement.

- a valid **email** address, AND
- one of the following acceptable methods of payment to pay the $7 CAD fee (non-refundable):
  - Visa<sup>®</sup>, Mastercard<sup>®</sup>, American Express<sup>®</sup>,
  - a pre-paid Visa<sup>®</sup>, Mastercard<sup>®</sup> or American Express<sup>®</sup>,
  - Visa Debit, or Debit Mastercard,
  - UnionPay<sup>®</sup>, or
  - JCB Card<sup>®</sup>.

## **After you apply**

Check that the passport number included in the eTA approval email matches exactly the number in your passport. If it's not the same, you need to [apply again with the correct passport number](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eta/apply.html).

**If you entered the wrong passport number, you may not be able to board your flight to Canada.**

- You may only find out at the airport if you made a mistake.
- You’ll have to reapply for an eTA.
- Depending on your situation, it may not be possible to get an eTA at the last minute.

**When you board your flight**

Your eTA is linked to the passport you used to apply. You need to present this passport when you check-in to your flight to Canada. You don’t need to print out any special document.

The airline staff will scan your passport to confirm that you have a valid eTA. If you **don’t** have one, **you won’t be able to board your flight**.

**Situations where you may need extra documents on arrival**

If either of the following situations applies to you or someone you’ll travel with, have the documents indicated in hand.

**You have a child under the age of 18 (a minor child)**

In Canada, a child under the age of 18 is considered a minor.

You may need to show

- a letter from one or both parents, or a legal guardian, that authorizes the minor child to travel to Canada, and
- other documents, such as adoption papers or a custody decree, depending on if the minor child travels alone or not

[Find out more about minor children traveling to Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/minor-children-travelling-canada.html)

**You were invited to come to Canada**

If you got a letter from a person or company that invited you to Canada, bring that letter with you. A border services officer may ask to see it.

[Find out more about letters of invitation](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/letter-invitation.html).

**You arrive in Canada**

A valid eTA and travel document don’t guarantee that you can enter Canada.

**We determine if you meet all entry requirements**

When you arrive, a border services officer will ask to see your passport and other travel documents. They’ll check your identity to make sure that you’re the same person who was approved to travel to Canada.

- **If you enter Canada at one of 10 major Canadian airports**
  - Your fingerprints will be checked automatically at a [primary inspection kiosk](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel-voyage/pik-bip-eng.html).
  - The system will check your identity against the information collected when your application was submitted.
- **If you enter Canada at smaller airports and all land ports of entry**
  - Your fingerprints may be checked if we refer you to a [secondary inspection](http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/pub/bsf5146-eng.html), where a border services officer will use a fingerprint verification device to check your fingerprints.

**You enter Canada**

If you pass the identity check, health assessment, and meet the [entry requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eta/after-apply-next-steps.html#entry-requirements), the border services officer may stamp your passport or let you know how long you can stay in Canada. You’re [normally allowed to stay in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eta/after-apply-next-steps.html#how-long) for up to 6 months.

In some cases, the officer may limit or extend your time in Canada to cover the planned purpose of your visit. Ask questions if you’re not sure about something.

You won’t be allowed into Canada if you give false or incomplete information. You must convince the officer that:

- you’re eligible for entry into Canada
- you’ll leave Canada at the end of your approved stay

If you don’t obey the conditions of your temporary resident status, we’ll ask you to leave Canada. Most people asked to leave Canada have the right to a fair hearing to review the decision.

## **Dual Canadian citizens need a valid Canadian passport**

Dual Canadian citizens can no longer travel to or transit through Canada by air with a non-Canadian passport. You need a valid Canadian passport to board your flight.

If your country needs you to enter and exit that country using a passport issued by its government, you will still need a valid Canadian passport to board your flight to Canada. **Make sure to carry both passports when you travel.** [Find out more about why you must travel with a valid Canadian passport when traveling by air](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/dual-canadian-citizens-visit-canada.html#background).

**Canadian-American dual citizens**

To fly to Canada, you need

- either your valid U.S. passport **or** your valid Canadian passport
- to meet the [basic requirements to enter Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eligibility.html)

**If you travel with just your valid U.S. passport, you**

- will need to [carry identification that shows your Canadian citizenship](http://www.cbsa.gc.ca/travel-voyage/td-dv-eng.html)
- may be asked to go through immigration screening

Even though you only need one of your passports to enter Canada, you should travel with **both**. Having both passports makes travel between Canada and the United States easier. Your passports prove

- your citizenships
- that you have the right to enter Canada and the U.S. without immigration screening

**Flying in a few days or at the airport without a Canadian passport?**

You may have the option to board your flight if you qualify for a special authorization. Otherwise, you will have to reschedule your flight and get a valid Canadian passport.

**Not sure if you are a Canadian citizen?**

If you were born outside Canada to a parent who is Canadian or are just not sure about your status, see [Am I Canadian?](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/eligibility/already-citizen.html) to find out

**Find out if you are eligible for a special authorization to board your flight to Canada**

You can apply for a **special** authorization if you:

- have not been issued a Canadian passport that is valid on the day of your travel
- have a flight to Canada that leaves in less than 10 days
- have a valid passport from a [visa-exempt country](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/entry-requirements-country.html#visaExempt)
- are **not** a Canadian-American dual citizen

**And one of the following:**

- have previously received a certificate of Canadian citizenship, or
- held a Canadian passport in the past, or
- were granted Canadian citizenship after having been a permanent resident of Canada.

Your information will be verified in our electronic systems to confirm that you are a Canadian citizen. This authorization will be valid for **only 4 days from the date of travel you select on the form**. If you don’t use it within this time, you will need to apply for a new authorization.

The Government of Canada will perform updates to its online system from **12:00 a.m. to 5:30 a.m. Wednesday, April 17, 2024**. Eastern time. The special authorization application form will not be available at that time. We apologize for the inconvenience. To apply for a special authorization, **please return after 5:30 a.m. ET on April 17**.

**Why you must travel with a valid Canadian passport**

Starting **November 10, 2016**, a new Government of Canada electronic system will verify that all passengers have an appropriate travel document before they can board a flight to Canada. This process will happen automatically when your travel document is scanned during check-in for your flight.

This change is part of a broader Government of Canada initiative aimed at ensuring that all Canada-bound passengers have appropriate travel documents to enter the country before they board their flight.

For Canadian citizens, including dual Canadian citizens, you must present an acceptable travel document that shows that you are a Canadian. This means you need a valid Canadian passport (or a Canadian temporary passport, or a Canadian emergency travel document) to allow airline check-in staff and border officials to confirm that you are Canadian.

A valid Canadian passport is the only reliable and universally accepted travel document that provides proof that you are a citizen and have the right to enter Canada without being subjected to immigration screening. Make sure that the expiry date of the passport is well beyond your planned return date.

**About the document: visitor record**

When you first come to Canada as a visitor, you use one of these documents to enter:

- a [visitor visa](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/extend-stay.html#visitor-visa) (also called a temporary resident visa)
- an electronic travel authorization (eTA)
- a valid passport or travel document

If you want to extend your stay in Canada as a visitor (stay in Canada longer), you need to apply for a [**visitor record**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/extend-stay.html#visitor-record). [A visitor record is **not** a visa](http://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1452&top=16).

A visitor record

- is a document that allows you to stay in Canada longer as
  - a visitor
  - a worker authorized to [work without a work permit in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/need-permit.html) or
  - a student authorized to [study without a study permit in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/study-permit-tool.html)
- includes a new expiry date
  - That’s the new date that you must leave Canada by.

**When to apply for a visitor record**

A visitor record is a document that allows you to **stay** in Canada longer. It **doesn’t guarantee** that you can leave and then **re-enter** Canada.

**Who can apply for a visitor record**

A visitor record is for people who want to do either of the following:

- extend their stay in Canada as
  - a visitor
  - a worker authorized to [work without a work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/need-permit.html) **or**
  - a student authorized to [study without a study permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/study-permit-tool.html)

If your application is approved, you will receive a letter with instructions to submit your passport to receive a visa.

If your application is refused, we’ll send you an explanation.

**When you arrive in Canada**

**Identity check**

When you arrive, we’ll check your identity to make sure that you’re the same person who was approved to travel to Canada.

- **If you enter Canada at one of 10 major Canadian airports**
  - Your fingerprints will be checked automatically at a [primary inspection kiosk](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/services/border-tech-frontiere/pik-bip-eng.html).
  - The system will check your identity against the information collected when your application was submitted.
- **If you enter Canada at smaller airports and all land ports of entry**
  - Your fingerprints may be checked if we refer you to a [secondary inspection](http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/pub/bsf5146-eng.html), where a border services officer will use a fingerprint verification device to check your fingerprints.

**Have your documents ready**

When you arrive, you’ll be greeted by an officer from the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).

The officer will ask to see your passport or travel documents. You should also bring the [documents you used for your super visa application (opens in a new tab)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/parent-grandparent-super-visa/get-documents.html) . Make sure these documents aren’t packed in your luggage.

A valid super visa and travel document (passport, titre de voyage or Certificate of Identity) **does not** guarantee that you can enter Canada.

**Accompanying minor children**

**You enter Canada**

If you pass the identity check and meet the [entry requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/parent-grandparent-super-visa/after-apply-next-steps.html#entry-requirements), the border services officer will stamp your passport, allowing you to stay in Canada for 5 years.

You won’t be allowed into Canada if you give false or incomplete information. You must convince the officer that

- you’re eligible for entry into Canada
- you’ll leave Canada at the end of your approved stay

It’s important to make sure that your passport is valid during your stay in Canada.

**Living in Canada**

Canada may be very different from your home country, which means there’s a lot to learn about it before you arrive. [Get to know Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/learn-about-canada.html), including its climate, people, government and way of life.

**Work or study in Canada**

**About the document: visitor record**

When you first come to Canada as a visitor, you use one of these documents to enter:

- an electronic travel authorization (eTA)

## **Event organizers and Canadian businesses - bring business guests to Canada**

**Step 1: Carry out your responsibilities**

- Perform due diligence checks on your potential business partner.
  - Before you enter into any formal partnership, you should investigate your potential partner’s business track record, assets and liabilities, reputation and current legal status. This can protect your company’s interests and reputation. It will also help you decide if aspects of your potential partner’s background would cause problems if you were to bring that person to Canada for business.  
     <br/>Please see the [Trade Commissioner Service](https://www.tradecommissioner.gc.ca/index.aspx?lang=eng) for advice.
- Liaise with the Canadian [trade commissioner responsible for the sector and country](http://tradecommissioner.gc.ca/trade-commissioner-delegue-commercial/search-recherche.aspx?lang=eng) your visitor is coming from.
- Provide your potential visiting business partner with 2 copies of a [letter of invitation](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/business/bring-business-guests/letter-invitation.html).
- Provide your potential visiting business partner with 24-hour contact information for a representative from your business. Your visiting partner may
  - be asked to provide the information to the border services officer when arriving in Canada, or
  - need to contact you due to travel delays

**Step 2: Register your international event with us and get certain support services (if applicable)**

- You can get useful information and support on Canada’s entry and visa requirements from our Special Events Unit.
- Find out more about how to [get support to organize an international event in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/business/bring-business-guests/organize-international-event-canada.html).

**Step 3: Find out if the person you’re inviting needs a visa or an electronic travel authorization (eTA)**

[Answer a few questions](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/visit/visas.asp) to find out what your participant may need to apply for, and what documents they’ll need to come to Canada. They will also need to

- carry [proper travel documents and identification](http://www.cbsa.gc.ca/travel-voyage/td-dv-eng.html) for themselves and any children traveling with them
- convince an immigration officer that they satisfy all other [requirements to enter Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eligibility.html), the participant may not be allowed to enter the country

**Step 4: Prepare a letter of invitation for the person you are inviting**

- [Find out what to include in a letter of invitation](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/business/bring-business-guests/letter-invitation.html) to a business visitor.
- If your event is registered with IRCC, include the event code in your letter of invitation.
  - Your participants should include the event code in their visa applications to identify themselves as event participants .

**Step 5: Encourage your participants to apply as early as possible and before booking their flights**

**Electronic travel authorization (eTA)**

If your visitor [needs an eTA](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/visit/visas.asp) (or is eligible for one), they must [apply online](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eta/apply.html) before traveling to Canada by air. It’s best for travelers to apply for their eTA **before** booking their flight to Canada.

In most cases, applicants will receive an approved eTA within minutes of applying. However, some requests may take several days to process. If this is the case, applicants can expect an email from us within 72 hours of applying that tells them what the next steps are.

**Visitor visa**

If your visitor [needs a visa](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/visit/visas.asp) to visit Canada, they **must** apply for a visitor visa just like any other temporary visitor to Canada. **There is no separate application for business visitors**. The visitor visa covers all visitors, including those coming to Canada on business.

**If they’re applying for the first time**, your visitor [needs to give their fingerprints and photo (biometrics](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/visit/biometrics.asp)), unless they’re exempt.

If the visitor gave biometrics before, they ’re probably still valid. If so, they don’t have to give them again. They can check when their biometrics expire by using the [check status tool](https://onlineservices-servicesenligne.cic.gc.ca/extapp/termsAndConditions?&lang=en).

We issue multiple- entry visas whenever possible because it makes it easier for business partners or contacts who need to make repeat visits to Canada. However, there may be circumstances when only a single-entry visa is issued.

Your visitor’s application may be delayed or refused if it’s not complete, or if required documents are missing or suspect. For example, applicants will need to give their fingerprints and photo (biometrics) to support their visitor visa application. [Check application processing times](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html) to find out how long it takes to process most complete applications.

**Step 6: Consider these things when organizing an international event or a meeting in Canada**

For more information, visit the [Office of Protocol’s website](http://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/index.aspx).

**Reception counter**

You may consider setting up a reception counter at the airport, where your representatives can greet delegates. Contact the airport in advance if you plan to do so.

**Border requirements**

All equipment and goods brought into Canada for the event must be reported to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). Contact the CBSA for information on border requirements for

- delegates and goods entering Canada
- documents and procedures that may be needed

Contact the nearest CBSA office in your province or area, or visit the [CBSA International Events website](http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/services/ie-ei/menu-eng.html).

**Minors traveling with business guests**

Canada has laws and regulations to protect children. Delegates who plan to travel with a child (17 years of age or younger) should consult the [entry requirements for minors](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/minor-children-travelling-canada.html).

**What to do if an eTA or a visitor visa is refused**

If your potential partner’s eTA or business visa is refused, please see [How do I get help if my application is refused](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=422&top=16)?

If there is new or additional information that should be considered, your partner can re apply and submit this new information. There is no minimum amount of time to wait before they can apply again.

## **Plan your trip across the border**

Every year, millions of Canadian citizens and visitors travel across our Canadian borders. Everyone wants their border crossing to go smoothly with fewer delays. The best way to make sure this happens is to know what to expect and be prepared.

**Travel and identification documents for entering Canada**

Make sure you carry proper identification for yourself and any children or minors traveling with you. You must be able to confirm your legal right or authorization to enter Canada at the border.

**Residents returning to Canada**

Carry a valid Canadian passport for all visits abroad, including visits to the United States (U.S.). It is the only universally accepted identification document, and it proves that you have a right to return to Canada.

**Acceptable documents to denote identity and citizenship**

Upon arrival at a Canadian port of entry, travelers must satisfy a CBSA border services officer (BSO) that they meet the requirements for entry into Canada. For Canadian citizens, permanent residents and persons registered under the Indian Act, this can be done through questioning and through verifying documentation such as a:

- Canadian passport
- Canadian birth certificate
- permanent residence card
- citizenship card
- Secure Certificate of Indian Status (SCIS) card or valid Certificate of Indian Status (CIS) card

If you do not have a passport, and are returning to Canada, the following documents can denote **identity and citizenship**:

- Certificate of Canadian citizenship (issued from 1954 to present)
- Enhanced driver's license issued by a Canadian province or territory

Permanent residents of Canada who are members of the NEXUS or FAST programs must travel with a passport and [proof of permanent residence](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/entry-requirements-country.html#lawful-pr-us), and may be asked to present these documents to the officer upon arrival at the border.

**Other acceptable documents for establishing Canadian citizenship**

The following documents may be used to establish **Canadian citizenship**. Upon presentation by travelers, the documents should be supported by other government issued photo identification:

- Certificate of Canadian citizenship (large form issued between January 1, 1947, to February 14, 1977)
- Certificate of retention (issued between January 1, 1947, and February 14, 1977)

**Acceptable documents for establishing Registered Indian Status and identity**

Every person **registered** under the _Indian Act_ can enter and remain in Canada by right as per subsection A19(1) of the _Immigration and Refugee Protection Act_. The Secure Certificate of Indian Status (SCIS), more commonly referred to as the Status card, is an identity document issued by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada confirming that the cardholder is registered as a Status Indian under the _Indian Act_.

**Note:** The Certificate of Indian Status (CIS) was replaced by the SCIS in 2009. Existing versions of the CIS will remain valid until their renewal date.

**Travel with children and minors**

When traveling with a minor, you should:

- carry copies of any legal custody documents, such as custody rights, if applicable
- arrive at the border in the same vehicle as the minor
- carry a consent letter if:
  - you share custody of the minor and the other parent or legal guardian is not traveling with you
  - you are not the parent or legal guardian of the minor

A consent letter must include the custodial parents' or legal guardians':

- full name
- address
- telephone number

Border services officers are always watching for [missing children](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/prog/misch-endis/menu-eng.html) and may ask questions about any minors traveling with you.

To avoid delays, have your consent letter notarized to support its authenticity. For more information on consent letters and to download an interactive form, visit [Recommended consent letter for children traveling abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/children/consent-letter).

**International visitors to Canada**

**Check** [Travel health measures](https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid)

All international travelers must carry acceptable identification and a valid visa (if necessary) when entering Canada. A passport is recommended because it is the only reliable and universally-accepted travel and identification document for the purpose of international travel.

International transport companies, such as airlines, must make sure that travelers have proper, valid travel documents. **If you do not have the proper documents, you may be delayed or refused entry into Canada**. What you need will depend on where you are from, how you are traveling, and what documents you are traveling with. Consult [entry requirements by country](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/entry-requirements-country.html).

When you enter Canada, a border services officer will ask to see your passport and a valid visa, if you are arriving from a country for which one is required. Visit the [Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada website](https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/visas.asp) to learn more about what travel documents are required.

Citizens of the U.S. who are members of the NEXUS program may present their membership card as proof of identification and as a document that denotes citizenship, when arriving by air (when coming from the U.S.), land, or marine modes.

Citizens of the U.S. who are members of the FAST program may use their cards as proof of identity when arriving by land and marine modes only.

Permanent residents of the U.S. who are members of the NEXUS or FAST programs must travel with a passport and [proof of permanent residence](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/entry-requirements-country.html#lawful-pr-us), and may be asked to present these documents to the officer upon arrival at the border.

All visitors arriving from or transiting through the U.S. are encouraged to visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/know-before-you-visit) for information concerning the U.S. Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, and the requirements to enter or return to the U.S.

**Electronic Travel Authorization**

**Visa-exempt foreign nationals** need an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) to fly to or transit through Canada.

Exceptions, or visa and eTA-exempt foreign nationals, include:

- U.S. citizens
- U.S Lawful Permanent Residents
- travelers with a valid Canadian visa
- Other exceptions

Canadian citizens, including dual citizens, and Canadian permanent residents **do not need to apply** for an eTA.

Foreign nationals from select visa-required countries may also travel to or through Canada by air using an eTA, [if eligible](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eta/eligibility/eta-x.html).

Be prepared: Apply for an eTA **before** you book your flight to Canada. Most applicants get approved within minutes. However, some applications can take several days to process so don’t wait until the last minute.

**Fake websites**

Travelers who apply for an eTA are advised to be cautious in all dealings with companies that claim to offer help in getting an eTA. These companies are **not** operating on behalf of the Government of Canada. Many have established websites that charge a fee to provide information and submit eTA applications.

This Government of Canada website is the official place to [apply for an Electronic Travel Application](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/eta.asp).
