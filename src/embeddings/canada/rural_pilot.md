## **Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot: about the pilot**

The Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot (RNIP) is a community-driven program. It’s designed to spread the benefits of economic immigration to smaller communities by creating a path to permanent residence for skilled foreign workers who want to work and live in one of the [participating communities](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/rural-northern-immigration-pilot.html#participating).

**We’ve extended the community recommendation period**

Communities now have until July 31, 2024, to recommend candidates.

**Key dates**

- **July 31, 2024:** Deadline for communities to recommend candidates
- **August 31, 2024:** Deadline for candidates to submit a permanent residence application to IRCC

**About the process**

There are 4 steps to applying for permanent residence under this pilot.

1. Check that you meet both
   1. [IRCC eligibility requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/rural-northern-immigration-pilot/pr-eligibility.html) and
   2. [the community-specific requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/rural-northern-immigration-pilot/pr-eligibility.html#community).
2. [Find an eligible job](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/rural-northern-immigration-pilot/community-partners.html) with an employer in one of the participating communities.
3. Once you have a job offer, [submit your application for recommendation](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/rural-northern-immigration-pilot/recommendation.html) to the community.
4. If a community recommends you, [apply for permanent residence](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/application-rural-northern-immigration.html).

Each community will also have its own

- additional eligibility requirements
- job search process
- community recommendation application process

This information will be available on its website.
