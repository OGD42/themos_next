## **Immigrate as a provincial nominee**

The provincial nominee program (PNP) is for workers who

- have the skills, education and work experience to contribute to the economy of a specific province or territory
- want to live in that province or territory
- want to become [permanent residents](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#permanent_resident) of Canada

Each province and territory has its own “streams” (immigration programs that target certain groups) and requirements.

For example, in a program stream, provinces and territories may target

- students
- business people
- skilled workers
- semi-skilled workers

**Understand the application options**

How you apply depends on which stream you’re applying to. You can apply using one of the following streams. The application process will vary based on the stream you choose.

**Express Entry process**

## **Quebec-selected skilled workers: About the process**

This is the application process for skilled workers who want to become permanent residents of Canada and live in Quebec.

Quebec has a special agreement on immigration with the Government of Canada. The province has its own rules for choosing immigrants who will adapt well to living there.

To immigrate to Canada as a Quebec-selected skilled worker, you must apply in the following 2 stages:

1. Apply to the [Government of Quebec](https://www.quebec.ca/en/immigration/work-quebec/skilled-workers) for a Quebec Selection Certificate (Certificat de sélection du Québec \[CSQ\]).
   - The Province of Quebec will assess you, using its own rules.
   - The certificate shows that the Province of Quebec has accepted you as an immigrant.
2. If the Province of Quebec chooses you and gives you a CSQ, you must apply to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada for permanent residence.

These instructions are for your application for permanent residence only.

**Who can apply**

**Eligibility**

You can apply as a Quebec-selected skilled worker if you

- hold a Quebec Selection Certificate (Certificat de sélection du Québec) from the Government of Quebec
- submit a complete permanent residence application, including [police certificates](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/police-certificates.html)

**If your application is approved**

Your COPR will have your photograph and information about who you are.
