**If your study permit extension hasn’t been approved yet**

**You won’t be able to study until we approve your study permit extension.**

If you applied to extend your study permit before it expired, you may be allowed to enter Canada if you meet all other requirements.

## **Working in Canada as an international student**

Work while you study, help your spouse or common-law partner get a work permit while you study, work temporarily or stay permanently in Canada after you graduate as an international student.

**Work on campus**

**Who can work on-campus**

**You can only start working in Canada when you start your study program. You can’t work before your studies begin.**

You can work as an international student in Canada if your study permit lists a condition that says you’re allowed to work on- or off-campus.

You can work on your school campus, without a work permit, if you

- are a full-time post-secondary student at a
  - public post-secondary school, such as a college, university, trade or technical school, or CEGEP in Quebec
  - private post-secondary school in Quebec that operates under the same rules as public schools in Quebec
  - private or public secondary or post-secondary institution in Quebec offering qualifying programs of 900 hours or longer leading to a diploma of vocational studies (DVS) or an attestation of vocational specialization (AVS)
  - Canadian private school that can legally award degrees under provincial law (for example, associate degree, bachelor’s degree, master’s degree or doctorate), but only if the student is enrolled in a study program leading to a degree authorized by the province
    - This may not include all programs of study offered by the private institution.
- have a valid study permit or [maintained status](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/work-on-campus.html#maintained-status)
- have printed conditions on your initial study permit allowing you to work on campus **and**
- have a [social insurance number (SIN)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/work-on-campus.html#SIN)

**Students with a part-time course load in their final semester**

If you were a full-time student in every semester of your program, but you’re studying part-time in your final semester to finish your required coursework, you can still work an unlimited number of hours on campus.

**Who can’t work on campus**

You **must** stop working on-campus:

- on the day you stop studying full-time, [unless you’re in your final semester](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/work-on-campus.html#part-time) and you meet other requirements
- when your study permit expires
- if you’re on an [authorized leave from your studies](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare-arrival/study-permit-conditions.html#s01.1)
- if you’re switching schools and aren’t currently studying

You can return to work only once you’re back to studying and you meet all the requirements to work on-campus.

**Where you can work**

“On-campus” means you can work at all the buildings on your school campus. If your school has more than one campus, you may only work at the campus where you’re studying in most cases.

You can work at other locations if

- you’re working as a teaching or research assistant and
- your work is strictly related to a research grant

In this case, you may work at a library, hospital or research facility associated with your school, even if they’re outside the campus. If you work at a hospital or other place where the protection of public health is important, you’ll need to have a [medical exam](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents.html#needs), unless you’ve already had one.

**Who you can work for**

An “on-campus” employer can be:

- the school
- a faculty member
- a student organization
- yourself, if:
  - you run a business that is physically located on-campus (for example: you own a coffee shop that is located on campus)
- a private business
- a private contractor that provides on-campus services to the school

**Get a social insurance number to work in Canada**

A social insurance number ([SIN](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin.html)) is a 9-digit number that the Government of Canada gives you. With this number, you can work in Canada and get government benefits and services.

To apply for a SIN to work on campus, you must have 1 of these conditions printed on your study permit:

- May accept employment on or off campus if meeting eligibility criteria as per [R186(f), (v) or (w)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html). Must cease working if no longer meeting these criteria.
- This permit does not authorize the holder to engage in off campus employment in Canada. May accept employment only on campus if meeting eligibility criteria as per R186(f). Must cease working if no longer meeting these criteria.

If you’re eligible to work on campus, but we didn’t include either of these conditions on your study permit, you can ask to have them added. There’s no fee to add these conditions to your permit.

You’ll need to [request an amendment to your study permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/request-amend-record-landing-confirmation-permanent-residence-valid-temporary-resident-documents.html) before you can [apply for a SIN](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin.html) from Service Canada.

**How many hours you can work on campus**

You can work as many hours as you want, **in addition** to working off campus, as long as you continue to meet the [eligibility requirements for working on campus](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/work-on-campus.html#eligibility).

## **Work off campus as an international student**

**Who can work off campus**

You and your employer must make sure you can work off campus without a work permit **before you start working**. If you start working off campus but don’t meet the requirements, you may have to leave Canada.

You can only start working in Canada when your study program has started. **You can’t work before you start your studies.**

If you’re able to work during your studies, it’ll say so in the conditions on your study permit.

If you’re eligible for off-campus work, you don’t need a work permit.

**Eligibility requirements**

  - a post-secondary [academic](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/glossary.asp#academic_program), [vocational](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/glossary.asp#vocational_training) or [professional training](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/glossary.asp#professional_training) program **or**

You can work off campus only if:

- you meet **all** of the requirements above, except the requirement to be a full-time student,
- **and**
- you’re only studying part-time, instead of full-time, because:
  - you’re in the last semester of your study program and you don’t need a full course load to complete your program **and**
  - you were a full-time student in your program in Canada, up until your last semester

**If you’re on an authorized leave**

If you’re on an [authorized leave from your studies](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare-arrival/study-permit-conditions.html#s01.1), or you’re switching schools and you’re not studying, you **can’t** work off campus. You can only return to work once you’re back to studying.

**Get a social insurance number to work in Canada**

A SIN is a 9-digit number that the Government of Canada gives you. You need one to work in Canada.

You can ask to have these conditions added if you’re [eligible to work off campus](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/work-off-campus.html#requirements). There’s no fee to add these conditions to your permit.

You must [request an amendment to your study permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/request-amend-record-landing-confirmation-permanent-residence-valid-temporary-resident-documents.html) before you can apply to Service Canada for a SIN.

**During scheduled breaks in the school year**

You can work full-time if you’re on a scheduled break, such as winter and summer holidays, or a fall or spring reading week. You’re free to work overtime or work 2 part-time jobs that add up to a higher than usual number of hours.

You must be a full-time student both before and after the break to work full-time.

You can’t work during a break that comes before you start your very first school semester.

**How many hours count as full-time work**

**If your program doesn’t have scheduled breaks**

You can work up to **20 hours per week**.

Working more than 20 hours per week is a violation of your study permit conditions. You can lose your student status for doing this, and may not be approved for a study or work permit in the future. You may also have to leave the country.

**How to calculate your hours**

You’re responsible for **both** of the following:

- keeping track of the hours that you work off campus **and**
  - Hours are defined as any time you spend earning wages or collecting a commission, even if you’re on call during these hours and not actually working.

  - To do this, you must show that you’re
    - actively pursuing your studies
    - not working more than 20 hours per week
    - meeting any other conditions listed on your study permit

**Self-employed students**

If you’re a self-employed person, you’re also responsible for keeping track of the hours you work off campus **and** proving that you’re complying with the conditions of your study permit.

Hours are calculated as any time you spend doing any of the following:

- earning wages
- being paid wages for performing a service or selling a product
- collecting a commission for performing a service or selling a product

- you’re only enrolled in an English or French as a second language (ESL/FSL) program
- you’re only taking general interest courses
- you’re only taking courses required to be accepted into a full-time program

If you weren’t eligible to work off campus, but your study situation has now changed, you may be able to change the conditions of your study permit.

You can apply to change the conditions of your permit if:

- you’ve changed your study program to one that may allow you to work off campus **and**
- your study permit says “This permit does not permit the holder to engage in off-campus employment in Canada”

**OR**

- we included a condition on your study permit that may no longer apply

**Example:** You have a study permit to complete prerequisite courses, such as an ESL or FSL course. You’re then accepted into a full-time study program. This would mean you could apply to have the condition (not being allowed to work off campus) removed from your study permit.

You must apply to change the conditions of your study permit. There’s a fee to make this change. You must change the conditions on your permit **before** you can apply for a SIN.

**Changing the conditions on your study permit**

You’ll need to [apply for a new study permit from within Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/apply.html#instructions).

## **Work or live in Canada after you graduate**

To work in Canada after you graduate, you need a work permit. Graduates of certain designated learning institutions are eligible for a post-graduation work permit (PGWP). If you're not eligible for a PGWP, you may still be able to work in Canada after you graduate. The work experience you gain while working may help you qualify for permanent residence.

**Processing times**

**Fees**

PGWP: $CAN 255

Restoration of student status and PGWP: $CAN 634

**About the PGWP**

You may be eligible for a post-graduation work permit (PGWP) if you graduated from a [designated learning institution](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html) (DLI) and want to stay in Canada temporarily to work.

Graduation from a DLI doesn’t automatically make you eligible for a PGWP. [Check the DLI list](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html) to find out which schools have eligible programs.

**How much of your online studies counts toward a PGWP?**

**Studies outside Canada**

**Studies in Canada**

**How long is a post-graduation work permit valid?**

**Starting February 15, 2024**, students who graduate from master’s degree programs of less than 2 years (8 months minimum) may be eligible for a 3 year PGWP.

The length of your PGWP depends on the level and duration of your study program, as well as the [expiry date of your passport](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation/eligibility.html#expires), whichever comes first.

**For master’s degree programs Updated 15 February, 2024**

**For all other programs**

**If your passport expires before your PGWP**

Make sure your passport is valid for the entire length of time you should be eligible. If your passport expires earlier

- we’ll only issue you a PGWP that’s valid until your passport expires
- we’ll tell you if you need to extend it to get the full validity

**Normally, you can only apply to extend a PGWP if we tell you to do so**. If this happens, you have to [apply on paper to extend your PGWP](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation/apply.html) so it will be valid for the full length it should be.

**Who can apply**

If you’re not eligible for a PGWP, you may still be able to work in Canada after you graduate.

**How to apply**

**How to apply for a post-graduation work permit**

You can apply for a post-graduation work permit (PGWP) from inside Canada or from another country, as long as you’re eligible.

You have **up to 180 days** after you graduate to apply for a PGWP.

When you apply, you must confirm the following:

- that you attended and completed your program
- the name of your program and
- the length of your program

You can confirm these by submitting any of the following:

- your degree or diploma
- your transcript or
- an official letter from your school

If your study permit will expire before you get your marks, you have 2 options. You can

- [apply for a visitor record](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/extend-stay.html) to stay in Canada longer or
- leave Canada and apply for your PGWP

**If your study permit expires before you apply**

If you don’t change your status to visitor and your study permit expires, you have **up to 90 days** after your study permit expires to apply for a PGWP and restore your status as a student.

To restore your status as a student, you must

- apply online for your PGWP and pay the correct fee ($255) **and**
- pay the fee to restore your status as a student ($379)
  - Because of system limitations, you must [pay the fees to restore your status as a student online](https://eservices.cic.gc.ca/epay/order.do?category=17) and attach a copy of the receipt to your PGWP online application. You don’t need to make a separate application to restore your status as a student.

You can’t work until your study permit and work permit have been approved.

If you don’t apply within the 90 days, or if the 90 days have already passed, you must leave Canada.

**Get your documents ready**

Before you can apply for a PGWP, you need one of the following to prove you’ve completed your studies:

- a degree or diploma
- an official letter from your school
- an official transcript, or a copy of your transcript from your school’s website

We may request other documents once we receive your application.

How you can apply for a PGWP depends on where you’re applying from. In most cases, you must apply online.

**To work in a field that requires a medical exam**

If you want to [work in a field that requires a medical exam](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents.html#needs), you can get an [upfront medical exam](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents.html#when) (no more than 90 days before you apply). With valid results from a medical exam on your file, your PGWP won’t have a condition that restricts the types of jobs you may work in.

**If you need to extend your PGWP or change its conditions**

You must [apply on paper](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation/apply/alternate-format.html) if you’re extending or changing the conditions of your PGWP. You can only extend your PGWP if your passport expired before your PGWP’s validity period.

**This would be indicated in a note on your initial PGWP.**

You may need to change the conditions on your PGWP if you need to provide an additional document, like a medical exam, after you already applied.

How to remove the job restrictions on your PGWP

There may be restrictions on your PGWP because you didn’t have a [medical exam](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents.html) before you came to Canada. These restrictions prevent you from working in

- jobs that bring you into close contact with people, such as
  - workers in health care settings
  - clinical laboratory workers
  - patient attendants in nursing and geriatric homes
  - medical students admitted to Canada to attend university
  - medical electives and physicians on short-term locums
  - workers in primary or secondary school settings or workers in child care settings
  - domestics
  - workers who give in-home care to children, the elderly or people with disabilities
  - day nursery employees
  - other similar jobs
- jobs in agriculture, if you’ve visited or lived in 1 of [these countries](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents/country-requirements.html) for more than 6 months during the past year

You must get a medical exam within 90 days of your arrival. You will need a chest X-ray and blood test.

You may need to pay a fee for this exam.

Once you get your medical exam results, you can ask to have these restrictions removed. To do this, you must follow the instructions below to [apply for an open work permit in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/ukraine-measures/ukraine-open-work-permit.html#apply-canada). Then, we can issue you a new work permit without job restrictions.

**How applying online helps you:**

- no courier fees or mail delivery time—we get your application instantly
- your application may be processed more quickly
- it helps you make sure your [application is complete](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=072&top=3) before you submit it
- you can quickly submit more documents online (if we ask you to)
- you get updates on the status of your application directly in your online account

**Get the instructions**

Answer a few questions to get your instructions.

**After you apply**

**Working while we process your application**

You can work full-time until we make a decision on your work permit application if you

- had a valid study permit when you submitted your application
- completed your study program
- were eligible to [work off campus without a work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/work-off-campus.html) while studying and you didn’t work more hours than you were allowed to

**If you received the WP-EXT for PGWP (IMM 0127 E) letter**

You’re authorized to work until a decision is made on your work permit application, even if the 180-day validity period has expired. If you need proof of authorization to continue working, you can ask for it by using our [web form](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/contacts/web-form.asp).

If these conditions apply to you and you need to prove to an employer that you’re eligible to work, provide the employer with a [copy of all the required documents](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1507&top=15).

If these conditions **don’t** apply to you, you must wait until your work permit arrives to begin your new job. It’s illegal to work in Canada without authorization.

If we refuse your work permit, you must stop working the day we notify you.

**Do you also need to apply for a visitor visa or eTA?**

**If you apply from outside of Canada**

We’ll issue you a new visitor visa or electronic travel authorization (eTA) when we approve your post-graduation work permit application.

**If you apply from inside Canada**

If you need a visitor visa to enter Canada, we won’t issue you a new one when we approve your post‑graduation work permit application. You’ll need to [apply for a new visitor visa](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/apply-new-temporary-resident-visa-within-canada.html) separately, if your current one is expired and you want to travel outside of Canada.

If you need an eTA to enter Canada by plane, we’ll issue you one when we approve your post-graduation work permit application.

**Travelling outside of Canada**

If you’re in Canada and want to travel outside of Canada, you must have a valid visitor visa or eTA. If you don’t have a valid visitor visa or eTA when you return to Canada, you may not be let back into the country (even if you have a valid post-graduation work permit).

If you leave and re-enter Canada after applying for your post-graduation work permit, you can still work full-time **while you wait for a decision.** Leaving and re-entering Canada does **not** stop you from being able to work full-time while you wait.

When you arrive in Canada, you’ll meet a [border services officer](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#border_services_officer), who will make sure you meet some basic requirements. To enter you Canada, you must

- have a valid travel document, such as a passport
- be in good health
- have no criminal or immigration-related convictions
- convince an immigration officer that you have ties—such as a job, home, financial assets or family—that will take you back to your home country
- convince an immigration officer that you will leave Canada at the end of your visit and
- have enough money for your stay. (The amount of money you will need can vary)
- **have valid results for an immigration medical exam (**[**if you needed one**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents.html#needs)**)**
  - Your exam is valid for 12 months from the day you get it.
  - The results must be valid on the day you enter Canada.
  - If your exam results will expire before you enter Canada, you must [get another medical exam](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents.html).
    - This applies even if your port of entry letter of introduction is still valid.
- prove that you’ll leave Canada at the end of your stay

**Spouses or common-law partners**

If we approve your application for a post-graduation work permit, your spouse or common-law partner may be eligible for an open work permit.

**Find your path to permanent residence**

You’ve studied in Canada and maybe you even have Canadian work experience. Now, you’d like to live here permanently. We have options for you to become a permanent resident!

The [Come to Canada tool](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/come-canada-tool.html) can help you explore your options. You can also use the cheat sheet below to compare programs. Visit the program’s eligibility page to get all the details.

Before you compare programs, here are two key terms you need to know:

**Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB)**

The Canadian standard used to describe, measure and recognize English language ability of adult immigrants and prospective immigrants who plan to live and work in Canada, or apply for citizenship. The Niveaux de compétence linguistique canadiens (NCLC) is used to assess abilities in the French language.

**National Occupation Code (NOC)**

The [National Occupation Classification](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/find-national-occupation-code.html) is a list of all the occupations in the Canadian labour market. It describes each job according to training, education, experience and responsibilities (TEER) categories. For immigration purposes, these are the main job groups:

- **TEER 0:** management jobs
- **TEER 1:** professional jobs that usually call for a degree from a university
- **TEER 2 or 3:** technical jobs and skilled trades that usually call for a college diploma or training as an apprentice
- **TEER 4:** intermediate jobs that usually call for high school or job-specific training
- **TEER 5:** labour jobs that usually give on-the-job training

## **Visitor visas for workers and students: How to apply from inside Canada**

A work permit or study permit is not a visa.

- We **won’t** automatically issue you a visitor visa if you **extend** your work or study permit.
- If you need a new visitor visa, you will need to submit a separate application.

**Who can apply for a visitor visa from inside Canada**

You can only apply for a visitor visa from inside Canada if you meet all of these criteria:

- already are in Canada
- hold a valid study or work permit
- want to **leave and return to Canada** in the near future, and
- have an existing [visitor visa](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#temporary_resident_visa) that’s expired, or is about to expire, or that was valid for only 1 entry

**If you already left Canada and need to apply for a new visitor visa**

You must follow the process to apply for a visa from [outside Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/apply-visitor-visa.html) instead of the inside Canada process outlined below. There are different requirements you may need to meet since you’re outside Canada.

**When to apply for your new visitor visa (in Canada)**

You should

- apply at least **2 months** before you plan to leave Canada
- not leave Canada until you get your visitor visa

**If you leave Canada before you get your new visitor visa**

You may be subject to

- additional requirements, like biometrics (if not already on file) and/or a medical exam
- a longer processing time
- a delay in your return to Canada
  - You’ll only be able to travel back to Canada once you get your new visitor visa in your passport. There’s no guarantee that you’ll be approved.

**If you must leave Canada for exceptional reasons before you get your new visitor visa**

Complete this [web form](https://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/contacts/web-form.asp) **before you leave Canada**.

- We may need to transfer your file to one of our offices abroad.
- We’ll also need to determine if you meet all the visa requirements for an applicant outside Canada.
- If you don’t contact us, there could be a processing delay or your passport could be returned without a visa.

**If you applied online to extend your work or study permit**

If we approve your application, we send you a message in your online account and mail you your new work or study permit.

**After we approve your application to extend your permit**

As soon as we approve your application to extend your work or study permit, you can apply for your visitor visa (even before you get your new work or study permit in the mail).

However, you must provide proof that we approved your application, such as:

- a screenshot of the approval message we sent to your online account
- your application number
- any other document that proves you have a valid and approved study or work permit extension

**Venezuelan passport holders**

You may need to [complete extra steps when you fill out your application](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/apply-new-temporary-resident-visa-within-canada.html#tr-venezuela-popup).

**How to apply for your new visitor visa**

You need to apply online in your IRCC secure account. If you don’t already have an account, [follow these steps to register](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/register.html).

You’ll need to select “Apply to Come to Canada” from your account main page to get started.

**Get the right application form**

To get the right application form, provide these answers in the online questionnaire:

- For the first question “What would you like to do in Canada?”, select
  - “Study” if you have a valid study permit or
  - “Work” if you have a valid work permit
- When asked “What is your current country/territory of residence?”, select “Canada”.
- Answer the questions on the next pages about your work or studies.
- You may be given the option to extend your current study or work permit or to apply for a “Temporary Resident Visa”. Make sure you select “Temporary Resident Visa”.

The application form listed in your document checklist will be called **Application for Visitor Visa (Temporary Resident Visa) Made Outside of Canada (IMM 5257)**. This is the form you need to fill out, even when you apply from inside Canada.

Use your account to pay your fees and check your application status.

## **How to get an open work permit for some current and former post-graduation work permit holders**

You may be eligible to get a one-time new open work permit that allows you to work in Canada for **up to 18 months** if your post‑graduation work permit (PGWP) has expired or will expire between September 20, 2021, and December 31, 2023.

To find out how to get your work permit, answer a few questions.
