## **Immigrate to Canada**

How you can immigrate to Canada, how to protect yourself from fraud and what to expect after you arrive in Canada

**Immigrate through Express Entry**

**How Express Entry works**

Express Entry is an online system that we use to manage immigration applications from **skilled workers.**

There are 3 immigration programs managed through Express Entry:

**Canadian Experience Class**

- for skilled workers who have **Canadian work experience**
- work experience must have been gained in the 3 years before you apply

[Learn more](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/canadian-experience-class.html)

**Federal Skilled Worker Program**

- for skilled workers with foreign **work experience**
- must meet criteria for education and other factors

[Learn more](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/federal-skilled-workers.html)

**Federal Skilled Trades Program**

- for skilled workers who are **qualified in a skilled trade**
- must have a valid job offer or a certificate of qualification

[Learn more](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/skilled-trades.html)

If you’re eligible for one of the above programs, you can also apply through Express Entry for the [Provincial Nominee Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/provincial-nominees.html). If you’re nominated, you’ll get extra points so you can be invited to apply quickly.

**Step 1: Find out if you’re eligible**

There are 2 ways to find out if you’re eligible for a program that is part of Express Entry:

- [answer a few questions to see if you meet the minimum requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/come-canada-tool-immigration-express-entry.html)
- [read the detailed requirements for each program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility.html)

**Step 2: Check your score**

If you’re [eligible](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/works.html#eligible) for one or more of the Express Entry programs and submit your profile, you’ll be ranked in the Express Entry pool using the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS).

The CRS is a points-based system we use to

- assess and score [your profile](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/submit-profile.html) and
- rank it in the Express Entry pool

To be invited, you need to have a score above the minimum points score for your [round of invitations](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/ministerial-instructions/express-entry-rounds.html).

- [Use the CRS tool to estimate your score](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp).

**Step 3: Get your documents ready**

If you decide to fill out a profile, you’ll need documents, such as language test results, to show you’re eligible for Express Entry.

Some documents take a long time to get, so you should get them ready early.

- [Get the documents you need](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents.html)

**Step 4: Fill out your profile**

Your Express Entry profile is where you give us information about yourself.

If you’re eligible, we’ll accept you into our pool of candidates and give you a CRS score.

- [Submit your profile](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/submit-profile.html)

**Step 5: Get an invitation and apply**

We send invitations to apply to the candidates with the highest scores in the pool. If we invite you to apply, you’ll have 60 days to submit your application.

We’ll process most complete applications that have all supporting documents in 6 months or less.

**Documents for Express Entry**

You need certain documents at different stages of the Express Entry application process.

**Documents for your profile**

You don’t need to upload documents to submit a profile, but you may need information from some or all of these documents:

- a passport or travel document
  - **Venezuelan passport holders:** You may need to [complete extra steps when you create a profile or fill out your application](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents.html#centred-popup1).
- [language test results](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/language-requirements.html)
- proof of Canadian education or an [educational credential assessment report](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/education-assessed.html) for immigration purposes if
  - you’re applying through the Federal Skilled Workers Program, **or**
  - you want to get points for the education you got outside Canada
- [provincial nomination](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/provincial-nominees/express-entry/get-confirm-nomination.html) (if you have one)

- proof of work experience
- certificate of qualification in a trade occupation issued by a Canadian province or territory (if you have one)
- proof of funds

**Documents for your application for permanent residence**

As of October 1, 2023, you no longer have to get an upfront medical exam before you submit your application for permanent residence through Express Entry. [Find out when to get your medical exams and what documents you need to submit.](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/medical-exams.html)

If we invite you to apply, you’ll need to upload copies of the documents you used for your profile (see list above). Most applicants will also need to upload the following:

- [police certificates](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/apply-permanent-residence/police-certificates.html)
- [proof of funds](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/proof-funds.html)

- death certificate, if you’ve declared your marital status as “widowed”
- adoption certificate, when a dependent child is listed as “adopted”

**Other documents**

You only need to submit these if we included them in your personalized document checklist. Your application may not be refused or rejected if you don’t submit these documents. They’re only used to check if you meet the requirements of the program you’re applying for.

- proof of relationship to a relative in Canada
- digital photos to confirm your identity
- other name to confirm aliases
- [authority to release personal information to a designated individual form (PDF, 1.74 MB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5475e.pdf)
- any other documents that you feel are relevant to your application

**Create an Express Entry profile: Online form**

If you want to come to Canada as a skilled immigrant, your first step is to create your profile and submit it to the Express Entry pool.

If you’re eligible, we’ll:

- place you in a pool with others who are also eligible
- give you a score and [rank you](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/criteria-comprehensive-ranking-system.html) using several factors
- invite you to apply to be a permanent resident of Canada (if you’re one of the top candidates)

Completing an online Express Entry profile or entering the pool **doesn’t** guarantee that we’ll invite you to apply for permanent residence. You can only apply if we send you **an invitation**.

**Step 1: Check if you’re eligible**

Use one of our online tools to find out if you’re eligible to apply through Express Entry. It'll take you about 15 minutes.

If you’re married or have a [common-law partner](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#common_law_partner), one of you must be the main or **principal** applicant. This person will submit a profile and list the spouse or partner.

The principal applicant should be the one of you most likely to:

- meet the eligibility requirements
- earn the most points in the [selection factors](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/federal-skilled-workers/six-selection-factors-federal-skilled-workers.html) (if applying under the Federal Skilled Workers Program)
- earn the most points in Express Entry’s [Comprehensive Ranking System](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp)

To check if you’re eligible, you have 2 options.

**Find out if you’re eligible using the Come to Canada tool**

Answer a few questions using an online tool to assess your eligibility.

The tool gives you a number at the end (a personal reference code) similar to this: JM1234567890. You will use this number to move your information from the tool to your Express Entry profile.

[Find out if you’re eligible](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/come-canada-tool-immigration-express-entry.html)

**Fill out the questionnaire in your secure account**

1. [Sign in to your account](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/account.html) and choose **Apply to come to Canada** under **Start an application**.
2. Choose “Express Entry” under **I do not have a Personal Reference Code**.
3. Answer the questions.

**Step 2: Create your Express Entry profile**

**If you used the online tool**

If you’re eligible, the online tool will send you to your online account to fill out an Express Entry profile.

1. Follow the instructions to create an account (if you don’t already have one).
2. Enter your personal reference code when it prompts you (only if you have one).
3. Enter your personal details.

**If you filled out the questionnaire in your secure account**

To complete your profile, you’ll need:

- information from [certain documents](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents.html) (for example, language test results)
- your [NOC](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/find-national-occupation-code.html) job title and code

You may exit the profile at any time. Your information will be saved in your account.

You have **60 days** to complete and submit your Express Entry profile. Otherwise, you’ll have to start again.

You won’t be asked to enter information about your dependent children when you create an Express Entry profile. We’ll only ask you for this information if you’re invited to apply for permanent residence.

**Step 3: Submit your Express Entry profile**

Once you’ve filled out your profile, you can submit it online. Based on the information you enter, we’ll figure out which program(s) under Express Entry you’re eligible for and may be invited to apply to.

You can’t choose the program you prefer when you create your profile.

**What to do while you’re in the pool**

While you wait in the pool, get ready to accept an invitation to apply. If we invite you to apply, you’ll have **60 days** to submit a complete application.

**Get your documents ready**

Having your documents ready will make it easier to apply within the 60 days.

**Language tests**

Check that your [language test results](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/language-requirements/language-testing.html) are valid. They are valid for 2 years after the date of the test result. They must also be valid on the date you apply for permanent residence.

If your results expire before then, you should:

- be tested again **or**
- apply before your test results expire (if possible) **or**
- decline the invitation and go back into the pool to be considered in the future

If you apply for permanent residence with language test results that have expired, we'll reject your application.

**Police certificates**

You’ll need to get [police certificates](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/apply-permanent-residence/police-certificates.html) for you and any of your family members who are 18 years old or older.

In some countries, it can take a long time to get police certificates. Ask for them now that you’re in the pool, so you can submit them before your 60 days are up.

**Find a job with Job Match**

You can start your job search by creating a Job Match account with Job Bank. Job Bank is a database that can help match you with employers looking for workers with your skills.

You can sign up for a Job Match account **after** you’re in the Express Entry pool. To do this, you’ll need the [Job Seeker validation code](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1006) you received when you submitted your profile. Once you come to Canada, you can keep using Job Bank to find a job.

- [Sign up with Job Bank](https://seeker.jobbank.gc.ca/seeker/)

**Try to improve your score**

While you’re in the pool, you can improve your [score](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/criteria-comprehensive-ranking-system/grid.html) and increase your chances of being invited to apply by:

- getting a [valid job offer](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/offer-employment.html) by
  - using Job Bank
  - promoting yourself to employers in Canada using private-sector job boards
- contacting provinces and territories and asking them to consider you for a [Provincial Nominee Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/provincial-nominees.html)
- improving your [language score](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/language-requirements/language-testing.html)
- improving your [education](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/education-assessed.html)
- gaining more relevant work experience
  - To gain points, your work experience must be under the [National Occupation Classification](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/find-national-occupation-code.html) listed in your profile.

**Keep your profile up-to-date**

You must make sure that the information in your profile stays true and accurate at all times. You must update your profile if your situation changes, for example if you:

- start a new career
- gain or lose a job offer
- get a new language test
- get married or divorced
- have or adopt a new child

If we find that you gave us false information or left out important details, we can:

**Express Entry rounds of invitations**

We rank candidates in the pool using a points-based system called the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). When we hold Express Entry rounds of invitations, we

1. choose the type of round we’ll hold
2. decide the number of candidates we need to invite
3. identify the highest-ranking candidates from the pool who are eligible for the chosen round type
4. invite these candidates to apply for permanent residence

**Types of rounds of invitations**

We hold different types of rounds of invitations throughout the year.

**1\. General rounds of invitations**

In general rounds of invitations, we invite top-ranking candidates in the pool who are eligible for [1 of the 3 programs managed through Express Entry](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility.html).

**2\. Program-specific rounds of invitations**

In program-specific rounds of invitations, we invite top-ranking candidates who are eligible for a specific Express Entry program.

For example, if we’re holding a round specifically for the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP), we would only invite candidates who are eligible for the PNP.

**3\. Category-based rounds of invitations**

For category-based rounds of invitations, the Minister establishes a category to meet a specific economic goal. We then invite top-ranking candidates in the pool who are eligible for this category.

**You must be eligible for** [**1 of the 3 programs managed through Express Entry**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility.html) **to be placed in the pool.**

Category-based rounds add to general and program-specific rounds by inviting top-ranking candidates who can help us meet specific economic goals.

[Find out how category-based rounds of invitations work](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/submit-profile/rounds-invitations/category-based-selection.html).

**Candidates with a provincial or territorial nomination**

We’ll continue to invite candidates with a provincial or territorial nomination through general and Provincial Nominee Program-specific rounds. These candidates have demonstrated they have the skills, education and work experience to contribute to the province’s or territory’s economy.

**Instructions for rounds of invitations**

Each round of invitations has a set of [instructions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/ministerial-instructions/express-entry-rounds.html) that are

- posted online at the time of the round
- used by the Express Entry system to invite candidates from the pool

The instructions include

- the date and time of the round
- the number of candidates that will get an invitation to apply
- the round type (general, program-specific or category-based)
- which immigration program(s) are included in the round, if this applies (for program-specific rounds)
- eligibility for the category, if this applies (for category-based rounds)

Final del formulario

You can [check the criteria for the program you've been invited to apply under](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility.html) to make sure you're still eligible.

By understanding your program requirements, you'll be more prepared to apply. It could also help you decide whether to accept an invitation to apply.

**Changes to your personal situation**

If your situation (or that of your spouse or common-law partner) changes, you should [re-calculate your score](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp) before applying online for permanent residence.

If your recalculated score is less than the [lowest score in your round of invitations](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/submit-profile/rounds-invitations.html), you should decline the invitation. If you decide to apply anyway, we may:

- refuse your application
- not refund your application fee

Some examples of changes that could lower your score:

- you no longer have a [valid job offer](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/offer-employment.html)
- you no longer have a provincial nomination
- your language test scores:

have expired **Respond to your invitation to apply**

If we invite you to apply for permanent residence, you'll get a message in your account telling you:

- which program you've been invited to apply for
- what to do next

You'll need to show proof of the information you gave us in your Express Entry profile. We’ll assess whether the information you submit in your application is different from what was in your profile.

If we find that you gave us false information or left out important details, we could:

- refuse your application
- find you inadmissible
- bar you for 5 years from applying to come to Canada for any reason

[Apply for permanent residence](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/apply-permanent-residence.html).

**Program requirements**

- - are lower after you were retested

**Declining an invitation to apply**

If you decline an invitation, you'll be put back into the Express Entry pool of candidates. You'll be considered in future rounds of invitations, [if you’re still eligible](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/submit-profile/respond-invitation.html#centred-popup).

The cut-off score varies from round to round. If your score isn’t high enough, you might not be invited to apply again. In some cases, you may have to take steps to be invited to apply again. For example, you may need to:

- [improve your score](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/submit-profile/waiting-pool.html#improve)
- update your Express Entry profile

There is no guarantee that you'll be invited to apply again. However, if you choose to re-enter the pool, declining an invitation **won't** affect whether or not you’re invited to apply later.

If you **don't** decline an invitation and you **don't apply within 60 days**, the invitation will expire and your profile will be removed from the pool. To be considered in future rounds of invitations you'll have to:

- fill out and submit a new Express Entry profile
- meet the eligibility
- be accepted into the pool again

**What to do if you’re not invited to apply**

If you’re not invited to apply within 12 months of submitting your Express Entry profile, it will automatically expire. You can see this date in your account.

When your profile expires, it will be removed from the system. You will get a message in your account.

You can still create a new profile. If your profile is about to expire, you can print out screen shots of your profile to make it easier to re-enter your data.

Don’t create a new profile until your existing profile expires. If you do, you’ll need to withdraw your existing profile first.

To withdraw your profile:

1. [Sign in to your account](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/account.html)
2. Go to “View the applications you submitted” on the main page
3. Click the “Withdraw profile” link
4. Click the “Continue” button below the “Warning!” text under the heading “What would you like to do today?”

If you don’t submit a new profile, you can’t mention Express Entry in your profiles on any job boards.

If you submit a new profile, you’ll get a new:

- Express Entry profile number
- Job Seeker validation code for Job Bank

**Translation of documents**

If one of your documents is in a language other than English or French, you must also upload

- an English or French translation that’s
  - stamped by a [certified translator](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#certified_translator)
    - The translator should photocopy your original document and stamp it if that’s what they based the translation on.
    - All stamps and seals that aren’t in English or French must also be translated. You can include a scanned copy of a letter explaining that you don’t need an affidavit because you used a certified translator.
  - **or**
  - accompanied by an [affidavit](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#affidavit) from the person who completed the translation

A certified translator is a member in good standing of a professional translation association in Canada or abroad. Their certification must be confirmed by a seal or stamp that shows the translator’s membership number.

A translator in the process of receiving their certification or accreditation is not considered a certified translator for IRCC’s purposes.

An affidavit for a translation is a document that states the translation is an accurate version of the original text.

The translator swears in front of a commissioner, who is authorized to administer oaths in the country where they live, that their translation of the original document is accurate. The commissioner or notary public must be proficient in English or French in order to administer the oath.

**Who can take an affidavit**

**In Canada,** an affidavit can be taken by a

&nbsp;[Varies by program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html)

You may need to [give your biometrics](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/visit/biometrics.asp) with your application. This processing time **includes** the time you need to give your biometrics.

**Causes of processing delays**

Your application will be delayed if

- we need to verify information

- we need to do more background checks
- your family situation isn't clear, for example,
  - a divorce or an adoption that isn't yet complete
  - child custody issues that haven't been resolved

**Keep your information up to date**

**If your Express Entry application is approved**

- confirmation of permanent residence (COPR)
- a permanent resident (PR) visa (if you're from a country that needs a visa)

Your COPR will have information about who you are, as well as your photograph.

Check to make sure your information is correct. It should be the same as the information on your passport. If there is a mistake on your COPR, contact us through your account.

We **can’t** extend your COPR, so you should make sure to **use it before it expires**.

**If you’re already in Canada**

**Make sure you keep your information up to date**

Use the [web form](https://services3.cic.gc.ca/ecas/?app=coanotify&lang=en) if you need to update your contact information or tell us about changes to your family situation (for example, marriage, birth, divorce or death).

**You need to confirm your permanent resident status virtually**

In most cases, we can confirm [permanent resident (PR) status](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card/understand-pr-status.html)

- without in-person interviews
- through a secure online portal

You don’t have to do anything until we contact you using the email or phone number you provided.

**Confirm your permanent resident status through the Permanent Residence Portal**

You’ll get emails from a mailbox ending in **cic.gc.ca**

1. Asking you to confirm your email address
2. Asking you to confirm you’re physically in Canada
3. Giving you information about the Permanent Residence Portal (and options if you can’t use it)

The portal is separate from your Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada secure account. **Don’t create your own account in the Permanent Residence Portal as this can delay the process.** We’ll create an account for you. Follow the instructions in the email we send you.

[Learn more about the Permanent Residence Portal](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/pr-confirmation-portal.html).

**You must tell us if you leave Canada before we grant you permanent resident status.**

**Permanent resident cards**

Once you become a permanent resident, we’ll make an electronic confirmation of permanent residence (e-COPR) available to you in the Portal so that you can provide proof of your new status in Canada. In this portal, we’ll also ask you to provide a photo so we can start the process of issuing your first [permanent resident card](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card.html). You don’t need to apply for your first PR card.

While you wait for your PR card, you can use your printed and signed e-COPR to

- prove you’re a permanent resident in Canada
- apply for government benefits and services for which you’re eligible (for example, to apply for your [social insurance number](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin.html) so you can work)

**If you’re outside Canada**

**Before you arrive in Canada**

There are things you can do to prepare for life in Canada

- use [free pre-arrival services](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/new-life-canada/pre-arrival-services.html), which help you
  - find out more about living and working in Canada
  - take steps to get recognition in Canada for your
    - [education](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/education-assessed.html)
    - [professional licences and certificates](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/skilled-trades.html#provinces)
- read about [living and finding work in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/new-life-canada.html)

**When you arrive in Canada**

You must have

- your valid passport or travel documents
  - Your passport must be a regular, private citizen passport.
  - You can’t immigrate to Canada with a diplomatic, government service or public affairs passport.
- your COPR and your permanent resident visa (if we gave you one)
- proof you have the funds to support yourself and your family after you arrive in Canada

When you arrive in Canada, you’ll meet an officer from the [Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)](http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html). The officer will

- make sure you’re entering Canada before or on the expiry date shown on your COPR
- make sure you’re the same person who was approved to travel to Canada (we may use your biometrics to do this)
- ask to see your passport and other travel documents
- ask you a few questions to make sure you’re still eligible to immigrate to Canada
  - The questions will be similar to the ones you answered when you applied.

To help speed up your entry to Canada, keep your passport and other documents with you at all times. **Don’t pack them in your luggage.**

We **won’t allow** you into Canada if you

- give false or incomplete information
- don’t satisfy the officer that you meet the conditions to enter Canada

If you’re admissible and there are no problems when you arrive, the officer will

- allow you to enter Canada as a permanent resident
- confirm your Canadian mailing address where we’ll mail your PR card

If you change your address within 180 days of arriving in Canada, you must tell us using our [web form](https://services3.cic.gc.ca/ecas/?app=coanotify&lang=en).

**Disclosure of funds**

If you [arrive in Canada with CAN$10,000 or more](http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel-voyage/ttd-vdd-eng.html), you **must tell the CBSA officer**. If you don’t tell them, you could be fined and your funds could be seized.

**What you can bring into Canada**

Before you travel to Canada, check the [CBSA website](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel-voyage/rpg-mrp-eng.html) to find out what you can and can’t bring into the country.

**After you arrive in Canada**

- read the [Welcome to Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/publication-welcome-canada-what-you-should-know.html) guide to help you adjust

## **Sponsor your family members**

You may be eligible to sponsor your family members to become permanent residents so they can live, study and work in Canada.

**Sponsor your spouse, partner or child: about the process**

**About the process**

If you’re eligible, you can sponsor your spouse, partner or dependent children to become permanent residents of Canada.

If you do, you must be able to:

- support them financially
- make sure they don’t need social assistance from the government

## **Sponsor your spouse, partner or children: check if you’re eligible**

**Who is eligible to sponsor their spouse, partner or child**

You can sponsor your spouse, partner or dependent child if:

- You’re at least 18 years old
- You’re a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident of Canada, or a person registered in Canada as an Indian under the Canadian [Indian Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-5/)
  - If you’re a Canadian citizen living outside Canada, you must show that you plan to live in Canada when the persons you want to sponsor become permanent residents.
  - You can’t sponsor someone if you’re a permanent resident living outside Canada.
- You’re able to prove that you’re not receiving social assistance for reasons other than a disability
- you can provide for the basic needs of any persons you want to sponsor

**If you live outside Quebec**

To become a sponsor, you must promise to financially take care of the persons you are sponsoring for a [period of time](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1355&top=14). We call this promise an undertaking.

The undertaking commits you to:

- providing financial support for your sponsored family members, starting when they become permanent residents
- repaying any provincial [social assistance](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/spouse-partner-children/eligibility.html#centred-popup1) your sponsored family members get during that time

Also, you and your sponsored family members need to agree to certain responsibilities during the undertaking period. We call this the sponsorship agreement.

The sponsorship agreement means that:

- you’ll provide for the basic needs of your sponsored family members
- the person you sponsor will make every effort to support themselves and their family members

When you apply, you’ll have to complete and sign a form that includes the undertaking and the sponsorship agreement.

**Income requirement**

In most cases, there isn’t an income requirement to sponsor your spouse or partner or dependent child. You **only** need to show that you have enough money to meet the income requirements **if:**

- you’re sponsoring a dependent child that has 1 or more dependent children of their own, **or**
- you’re sponsoring a spouse or partner that has a dependent child, and their dependent child has 1 or more children of their own.

The [Financial Evaluation form instructions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-5482-instruction-fill-financial-evaluation-form-1283.html) explain how much money you’ll need and how to fill out the form.

You’ll get the form when you download your application package.

**If you live in Quebec**

You must meet [Quebec’s immigration sponsorship requirements](https://www.quebec.ca/en/immigration/sponsor-family-member/sponsoring-spouse-conjugal-partner/verifying-your-eligibility) after we approve you as a sponsor. You must sign an [undertaking](https://www.quebec.ca/en/immigration/sponsor-family-member/sponsoring-spouse-conjugal-partner/submitting-undertaking-application) with the province of Quebec.

The Quebec ministry in charge of immigration will assess your [income](https://www.quebec.ca/en/immigration/sponsor-family-member/calculating-income).

**Who can’t sponsor their spouse, partner or child**

You can’t sponsor your spouse, partner or child if:

- you’re less than 18 years old
- you won’t live in Canada when the persons you want to sponsor become permanent residents
- you’re not a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident of Canada, or a person registered in Canada as an Indian under the Canadian [Indian Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-5/)

- your permanent residence application is still in process
  - You must have permanent resident status at the time you submit your sponsorship application.

You may **not** be eligible to sponsor your spouse, partner if you:

- were sponsored by a spouse or partner and you became a permanent resident less than 5 years ago
- are still financially responsible for a previous spouse or partner that you sponsored. This means you’re still bound by the 3 year undertaking to take care of this person.

You may **not** be eligible to sponsor your spouse, partner **or child** if you:

- you have already applied to sponsor the spouse, parent or child you are currently seeking to sponsor and a decision on that application hasn’t been made
- are in jail, prison, or a penitentiary
- **didn’t** pay back:
  - an immigration loan
  - a performance bond
  - court-ordered family support payments such as alimony or child support (not applicable if [you live in Quebec](http://www.immigration-quebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/immigrate-settle/family-reunification/requirements-sponsor/index.html))
- didn’t give the financial support you agreed to when you signed a sponsorship agreement to sponsor someone else in the past (not applicable if [you live in Quebec](http://www.immigration-quebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/immigrate-settle/family-reunification/requirements-sponsor/index.html))
- declared bankruptcy and are not [discharged](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br02677.html) (not applicable if [you live in Quebec](http://www.immigration-quebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/immigrate-settle/family-reunification/requirements-sponsor/index.html))
- receive social assistance for a reason other than a disability

There may be other reasons that make you ineligible to sponsor your spouse, partner or child. If we determine you’re not eligible to sponsor, we’ll tell you why.

**Who you can sponsor**

You can sponsor your [spouse](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/spouse-partner-children/who-you-can-sponsor.html#spouse), [common-law partner](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/spouse-partner-children/who-you-can-sponsor.html#common-law), [conjugal partner](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/spouse-partner-children/who-you-can-sponsor.html#conjugal-partner) or [dependent children](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/spouse-partner-children/who-you-can-sponsor.html#dependant).

**Your spouse**

Your spouse can be either sex and must be:

- legally married to you
- at least 18 years old

**Your common-law partner**

Your common-law partner:

- **isn’t** legally married to you
- can be either sex
- is at least 18 years old
- has been living with you for at least 12 consecutive months, meaning you’ve been living together continuously for 1 year in a conjugal relationship, without any long periods apart
  - Any time spent away from each other should have been
    - short
    - temporary

If you or your common-law partner choose to end the relationship, we consider the relationship to be over.

You’ll need to [give proof of your common-law relationship](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=347&top=14).

**Your conjugal partner**

Your conjugal partner:

- isn’t legally married to you or in a common-law relationship with you
- can be either sex
- is at least 18 years old
- has been in a relationship with you for at least 1 year
- lives outside Canada
- can't live with you in their country of residence or marry you because of significant legal **and** immigration reasons such as
  - their marital status (for example, they’re still married to someone else in a country where divorce isn’t possible)
  - their sexual orientation (for example, you are in a same-sex relationship, and same-sex relationships are not accepted, or same-sex marriage is illegal where they live),
  - persecution (for example, your relationship is between different religious groups which is not accepted and they may be punished legally or socially)

You’ll need to give proof that you could not live together or get married in your conjugal partner’s country (for example, proof of refused long-term stays in each other’s country).

**Dependent children**

Children qualify as dependants if they meet **both** of these requirements:

- they’re **under** 22 years old
- they don’t have a spouse or common law partner

Children 22 years old or older qualify as dependants if they meet both of these requirements:

- they are unable to financially support themselves because of a mental or physical condition
- they have depended on their parents for financial support since before the age of 22

With the exception of age, your dependent child must continue to meet these requirements until we finish processing your application.

**Use our** [**online tool to check if a child qualifies as a dependant**](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/immigrate/sponsor/aod-tool.asp)**.**

If they qualify as a dependent child, you can sponsor

- **your own child**
  - If you’re a Canadian citizen, your child may also be a Canadian citizen, even if they weren’t born in Canada. You can’t sponsor your child for permanent residence if they’re Canadian citizens already. [Check if your child is already a Canadian citizen.](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/canadian-citizenship/overview/who-canadian-citizen.html)
  - If you’re sponsoring **just** your child, without sponsoring your spouse or partner, you’ll name your child as the [principal applicant](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-5525-basic-guide-sponsor-your-spouse-partner-child.html#principal) in the application. You’ll have to show that the other parent or legal guardian agrees to your child immigrating to Canada. See your [checklist](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/information/applications/spouse.asp#country) for what you’ll need to provide.
  - If the child you want to sponsor has a child of their own (your grandchild), you’ll include your grandchild as a dependant in the application.
  - If you want to sponsor your **adopted** child or an orphaned family member, follow the instructions to sponsor your [adopted child](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadians/adopt-child-abroad/processes/choose-process/immigration.html) or [orphaned family member](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/other-relatives/who-you-can-sponsor.html) instead.
- **your spouse or partner and their child**
  - If you’re sponsoring your spouse or partner **and** a child (either their own child or a child you’ve had together), you’ll name your spouse or partner as the [principal applicant](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-5525-basic-guide-sponsor-your-spouse-partner-child.html#principal) and the child as the dependant in the application.
  - If the child you want to sponsor has a child of their own, you’ll include the grandchild as a dependant in the application.

**Eligibility of the people you’re sponsoring**

To show they meet the eligibility requirements, your spouse, partner, dependent child and their dependent children (if applicable) must provide:

- all required forms and documents with their application
- any additional information we request during processing, including
  - [medical exams](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-permanent-residents.html#when)
  - [biometrics](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/campaigns/biometrics/facts.html)

You can’t sponsor someone who is [inadmissible](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/inadmissibility.html) to Canada. This means they’re not allowed to come to Canada

**How to apply**

To apply to sponsor your spouse, partner or child, there are 2 applications:

1. You must apply to become a sponsor.
2. Your spouse, partner or child must apply for permanent residence.

If you already have a work permit, you can keep working as long as the permit is valid.

You may be eligible to [apply for an open work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/spouse-partner-children/spouse-common-law-partner-canada-open-work-permit.html) if

- you live in Canada with the person sponsoring you
- you got an acknowledgement of receipt letter that says your permanent residence application is being processed

We’ll refuse your open work permit application **if you submit it with your application for permanent residence** in the Permanent Residence Portal.

**Using an immigration representative**

If you’re a representative, [find out how you can create an account and submit applications on behalf of your clients](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigration-citizenship-representative/pr-representatives-online.html).

If you want to appoint someone to do business with us on your behalf, you must

A representative can fill out forms and communicate with us on your behalf through their own account. They can also

Your spouse or partner may be eligible for faster processing if you

Your spouse or partner must still meet **all** of the requirements to be [eligible for a visitor visa](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eligibility.html).

**What happens at the border**

The border officer will:

- check that their permanent resident visa and Confirmation of Permanent Residence haven’t expired
- ask your family members to confirm information that they gave in their application

Your sponsored family members must tell the officer of any funds they’re bringing into Canada, including:

- cash
- stocks
- bonds

**Immigration process — Intercountry adoption: About the process**

There are 2 processes that you must go through when you sponsor your adopted child from another country: the [adoption process](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadians/adopt-child-abroad/processes.html) and the immigration process.

The immigration process has 2 parts:

1. the application for sponsorship
2. the application for permanent residence for the child

After your child arrives in Canada as a permanent resident, you can apply for citizenship on the child’s behalf. However, the adoption must be finalized before the child can be granted citizenship.

**Sponsor your relatives: About the process**

You may be able to sponsor certain relatives to immigrate to Canada under the Family Class if you’re at least 18 years old and a:

- Canadian citizen or
- person registered in Canada as an Indian under the Canadian [Indian Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-5/) or
- permanent resident of Canada

If you sponsor a relative to come to Canada as a permanent resident, you must:

- support your relative financially when they arrive
- be able to meet basic needs for yourself and your relative, such as:
  - food
  - shelter
  - clothing
- make sure your relative doesn’t need social assistance

**Who can sponsor**

**Sponsoring an eligible relative**

You can sponsor certain relatives if you’re 18 years of age or older and a:

- Canadian citizen **or**
- person registered in Canada as an Indian under the Canadian [Indian Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-5/) **or**
- permanent resident of Canada

You must live in Canada to sponsor eligible relatives unless you:

- are a Canadian citizen who lives abroad **and**
- plan to return to Canada when your relatives immigrate **and**
- are [sponsoring](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/spouse-partner-children.html) your:
- spouse **or**
- common-law or conjugal partner **or**
- dependent children who have no dependent children

If you live in Quebec, you must also meet [Quebec](http://www.immigration-quebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/index.html)’s conditions to be a sponsor after we approve you as a sponsor. This includes signing an “undertaking” with the province. This is a contract that binds your sponsorship.

**Your responsibilities**

When you sponsor a relative to become a permanent resident of Canada, you must:

- meet set income guidelines
- agree in writing to give financial support to your relative and any other eligible relatives coming with them:
  - beginning on the date they become a permanent resident
  - for up to 20 years (depending on their age and how you’re related)

The person you sponsor must sign an agreement saying they will make the effort to support themselves. This includes sponsored dependent children 18 or older. Dependent children under 19 don’t have to sign this agreement.

**Who isn’t eligible to sponsor a relative**

You may **not** be able to sponsor a relative if you:

- are in prison
- have not paid your alimony or child support payments
- have declared bankruptcy and haven’t been released from it yet
- got social assistance for reasons other than being disabled
- didn’t pay back an immigration loan, made late payments or missed payments
- sponsored another relative in the past and didn’t meet the terms of the sponsorship agreementwere convicted of a violent crime, any offence against a relative or any sexual offence, depending on details of the case, such as:
  - the type of offence
  - how long ago it was
  - whether a [record suspension](https://www.canada.ca/en/parole-board/services/record-suspensions.html) was issued (formerly called “pardons” in Canada)

Other things not on this list may stop you from being able to sponsor a relative.

**Who you can sponsor**

You can only sponsor relatives like a brother, sister, aunt or uncle in very specific situations. If your family member doesn’t meet the criteria below, you can use our [Come to Canada tool](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/come-canada-tool.html) to find out which programs they may be eligible to apply for.

Depending on your situation, there are 2 options for who you can sponsor.

- they’re related to you by blood or adoption
- both their mother and father passed away
- they’re under 18 years of age
- they’re single (not married or in a common-law or conjugal relationship)

You **can’t** sponsor your brother, sister, nephew, niece or grandchild if:

- someone else other than their parents is taking care of them while one or both their parents are alive

  - permanent resident
  - registered Indian under the [Indian Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-5/)

If the relative you want to sponsor has a spouse, partner, or dependent children who will come with them to Canada, you must include them on the same sponsorship application.

**Examples of who you can sponsor**

See the examples below to better understand who you can sponsor.

**Example 1: Eligible to sponsor an aunt**

Veronica doesn’t have a spouse or a common-law partner. She has no children, and lives in Canada as a permanent resident. Her parents and grandparents have all passed away and she doesn’t have any relatives in Canada who are Canadian citizens, permanent residents or registered Indians. Veronica would like to sponsor her aunt Betty, who she is very close with. Her aunt Betty is married and has a daughter.

Veronica meets the requirements to sponsor her aunt because she doesn’t have:

- a close living relative she could sponsor instead (such as a spouse, partner, child, orphaned sibling, parent or grandparent) and
- any other relative such as an aunt who is a citizen, permanent resident or registered Indian of Canada.

On the application, Betty will be designated as the principle applicant and her husband will be designated as a dependant.

Betty’s daughter can be included on the application only if she qualifies as a [dependent child](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/immigrate/sponsor/aod-tool.asp). If her daughter is older than the age limit or she doesn’t meet all the requirements, she can’t be added to Betty’s application and will have to immigrate to Canada on her own.

**Example 2: Eligible to sponsor a cousin**

Sam is an only child. His parents and grandparents have passed away. He was raised in the United States by his only cousin. He immigrated to Canada as a permanent resident. He’s single (doesn’t have a spouse or a common-law partner). Sam doesn’t have any relatives in Canada who are Canadian citizens, permanent residents or registered Indians. Sam wants to sponsor his American cousin. His cousin is single (doesn’t have a spouse or a common-law partner).

Sam meets the requirements to sponsor his cousin to come to Canada because he doesn’t have:

- a close living relative he could sponsor instead (such as a spouse, partner, child, sibling, parent or grandparent) and
- any other relative who is a citizen, permanent resident or registered Indian of Canada.

**Example 3: Not eligible to sponsor an aunt by marriage**

Aba is a Canadian citizen. The only family she had in Canada was her mother, who passed away. Aba has always been close to her mother’s only brother and his wife. Aba’s uncle recently passed away, and Aba would like to sponsor his wife (her aunt by marriage) to come to Canada. Aba does **not** meet the requirements to sponsor her aunt, because they’re not related by blood.

**Who you can’t sponsor**

You can’t sponsor someone who is [inadmissible](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/inadmissibility.html) to Canada. This means they’re not allowed to come to Canada.

**How to apply**

There are two stages in the process for your eligible relatives to become permanent residents.

1. You apply to sponsor your relatives.
2. Your family members must apply for permanent residence.

You must send both your sponsorship application and the permanent residence application for your relatives at the **same time**.

To apply as a sponsor, you must be at least 18 years of age and a:

- Canadian citizen or
- person registered in Canada as an Indian under the Canadian [_Indian Act_](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-5/) or
- permanent resident of Canada

We’ll process your application to sponsor and write you to tell you if we approve your application.

**How to apply**

**You must now apply online**

As of September 23, 2022, it is now mandatory to apply online.

If you can’t apply online, and require accommodations, including for a disability, you can ask for the application in [another format](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/how-to-apply-online.html#alternative) (paper, braille or large print).

**Using an immigration representative**

If you’re a representative, [find out how you can create an account and submit applications on behalf of your clients](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigration-citizenship-representative/pr-representatives-online.html).

If you want to appoint someone to do business with us on your behalf, you must

- download a [Use of a Representative \[IMM 5476\] (PDF, 1.48 MB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5476e.pdf) or [Authority to release personal information to a designated individual form \[IMM 5475\] (PDF, 2.2 MB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/kits/forms/imm5475/01-05-2021/imm5475e.pdf) – which ever applies
- complete it
- sign it digitally or by hand and get your immigration representative or designated individual to do so also
- upload it with your application

An immigration representative (an immigration consultant or lawyer) can give you advice and help you with your application for a fee. But they can’t

- open a portal account on your behalf
- electronically sign the application for you
- sign into the portal using your username and password

A representative can fill out forms and communicate with us on your behalf through their own account. They can also

- help you prepare the documents you need to upload
- answer questions about the forms

After you read the declaration, **you must be the one who types your name**. This is the legal requirement for your application to be considered “signed,” according to Canada’s immigration law.

**Photo specifications**

You need one photo for each person on your application.

Follow the instructions in the online application to scan and upload **both sides** of the photo.

**Technical issues**

If you’re having technical issues with the permanent residence online application portal, contact us using the [web form](https://secure.cic.gc.ca/enquiries-renseignements/canada-case-cas-eng.aspx)

- under **type of application/enquiry**, choose **technical difficulties** from the drop-down menu
- in the text box, **specify that you’re applying under the Parents and Grandparents Program** to make sure you get a fast response
- upload screenshots from your account that show us
  - the page where you’re having problems
  - the error message(s) you get

If you need to upload a number of images, find out [how to combine them into 1 document](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1160&top=23).

**Get fingerprints and photo taken**

If you’re between 14 and 79 years old, you may need to give your fingerprints and photo (biometrics).

- The [biometric fee](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/other-relatives/apply.html#biometric-fee) must be paid **when the application is submitted.** Otherwise you may experience delays.
- Get this done **as soon as you get the letter** from us that tells you to give biometrics.
- You have **30 days** to do this from the date on the letter.

**Pay fees online**

**Our permanent residence fees are increasing**

The fees for all permanent residence applications are increasing on April 30, 2024. [Find out more about how the fees are changing](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/notices/increase-permanent-residence-fees-april-2024.html).

Find out [how to pay fees](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/information/fees/index.asp).

**Submit the online application**

Before you submit the application, make sure you:

- answer all questions
- electronically sign your application (type your full name exactly as shown on your passport)
- include your processing fee receipt
- upload all the supporting documents

**After you apply**

**Application assessment process**

We’ll review your sponsorship application and return it to you if:

- it's incomplete
- the sponsorship and processing fees are missing

If we begin to process your application, we’ll:

- send you an acknowledgment of receipt letter with an application number,
- assess your eligibility as a sponsor, and
- assess if the person you are sponsoring meets the permanent residence requirements.

**Processing time** [**<sup>?</sup>**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/other-relatives/after-apply-next-steps.html#processing-times)

[Varies by country](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html)

[View current processing times](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html) to find out how long it will take us to process your application.

**If we refuse you as a sponsor**

Your relative can still apply for permanent residence. Their application may not be approved.

**If we approve you as a sponsor**

We’ll assess if the person you want to sponsor meets the permanent residence requirements. If their permanent residence application is refused, we’ll let you know why the application was refused and how to appeal the decision.

**Your relative can link their application to their online account**

When we start processing your family member’s application, we’ll send them a letter with their application number.

After they get this letter, the principal applicant can link their application to their online account. This way, they can communicate with us quickly and securely and get updates and messages about their application online.

**You (the sponsor) can link their application for them if you’re** [**handling your family member’s application**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/other-relatives/after-apply-next-steps.html#application-help) **and you’re designated as their representative.**

See the top [questions about linking your application](http://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/results-by-topic.asp?st=23.4).

**Check the status of your application**

**For sponsors**

Sponsors can check the status of their application by using our [online tool](https://services3.cic.gc.ca/ecas/security.do?lang=en).

As the sponsor, if you want to check on your family member’s application status, you must first [request access to their information](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/sponsor-parents-grandparents/after-apply-next-steps.html#application-help).

**For the persons being sponsored**

The persons you’re sponsoring can check their application in 2 ways. They can either

- use our [client application status tool](https://services3.cic.gc.ca/ecas/security.do?app=ecas&lang=en), which is updated daily **or**
- [create an online account](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/account.html) and [link their paper application](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/account/link-paper-online.html) to it
  - They can **only do this when** we’ve [started processing their application](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/sponsor-parents-grandparents/after-apply-next-steps.html#approved) and have sent them their application number.

**If your processing time has passed**

If the [normal processing time](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html) for your application has passed, you can contact us using our [web form](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc/web-form2.html).

**Change in contact information or in personal circumstances**

To avoid delays in processing, make sure your contact information and your application details are up to date.

Use our [web form](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc/web-form2.html) to tells us about changes in your application, such as

- the birth or adoption of a child
- a marriage or a divorce
- contact information updates, including
  - email
  - phone number
  - mailing address

Keep checking your old contact methods until we update your application.

**Do not contact us by mail if you have changes to your contact information or your application.** We will not acknowledge your request and your application will not be updated. This could lead to a delay in processing your application.

**Withdraw your sponsorship application**

You can withdraw your sponsorship application any time **before** the relative you’re sponsoring becomes a permanent resident of Canada.

You may be able to get a refund if we haven’t started processing your application.

Use our [web form](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc/web-form2.html) to request the withdrawal of your sponsorship application. In your request, include your

- full name
- date of birth
- country of birth
- application number (if you know it)
- relative’s client ID number (UCI) (if you know it)
- signed withdrawal request letter

**Add or change a representative or get access to your family member’s information**

Even as the sponsor, you don’t automatically get access to your family member’s information. You have to request it.

**If you want to handle your family member’s application for them**

You’ll be acting as what we call a [representative](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigration-citizenship-representative/learn-about-representatives.html) if you want to

- fill out and submit your relative’s application for them
- communicate with us on their behalf

To become your family member’s representative, complete, sign and save [the form to appoint or change a representative](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/use-representative.html) (IMM 5476). The people you’re sponsoring must also sign the form **unless** they’re under 18.

Include the form with your application. If you’ve already submitted your application, send it to us through our [web form](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc/web-form2.html).

In your request, include your

- full name
- date of birth
- country of birth
- application number (if you know it)
- relative’s client ID number (UCI) (if you know it)

You can upload the form after you’ve completed all the required fields.

**If you want to check on your family member’s application status**

As the sponsor, you may want to have access to your relative’s information without being in charge of their application. For example, you may want to check their application status on their behalf, but not act as their [representative](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigration-citizenship-representative/learn-about-representatives.html).

To protect their privacy, they need to give us their written consent before we’ll share any of their personal information with you or give anyone access to their application information.

Find out how the persons you’re sponsoring can [give you access to their information](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigration-citizenship-representative/application-access.html).

**Submit your right of permanent residence fee or request a refund**

Use our [web form](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc/web-form2.html) if

- the visa office has instructed your relative to pay the right of permanent residence fee or
- you want a refund for the right of permanent residence fee

You can only get a refund once you’ve declined your right of appeal.

In your request, include your

- full name
- date of birth
- country of birth
- application number (if you know it)
- relative’s client ID number (UCI) (if you know it)
- copy of the official receipt
- signed right of appeal letter

**Prepare for arrival**

When you arrive in Canada, you must show your Confirmation of Permanent Residence (COPR) and your permanent resident visa to a Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) officer at the point of entry to Canada. The officer will make sure your travel and immigration documents are correct.

- The IRCC officer will check that your permanent resident visa has not expired. The expiry date is shown on the visa. You cannot use the visa after it expires. A permanent residence visa cannot be extended, so make sure you use it within the time limit.
- You must bring a valid passport from your home country with you. Your passport must be a regular, private passport. You cannot immigrate to Canada with a diplomatic, government service or public affairs passport.
- You will have to answer questions like the ones you answered on your Application for Permanent Residence in Canada. The IRCC officer asks these questions to verify information on the application.
- You must inform the IRCC officer of any funds you are bringing into Canada (cash, stocks, bonds, money orders, traveller’s cheques, etc.)

If there are no problems when you arrive in Canada, the IRCC officer will authorize you to enter Canada as a permanent resident. The officer will also use the address on your COPR to have your permanent resident card mailed to you. Make sure your Canadian address on the COPR is correct.

Permanent residents are given the permanent resident card as proof of their status in Canada. Your card will be mailed to your Canadian address after you arrive in Canada as a permanent resident.

Sponsor your parents and grandparents

**Check if you’re eligible**

You can sponsor your own biological or adopted parents and grandparents if

- you’re [invited to apply](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/sponsor-parents-grandparents/selected.html)
- you’re at least 18 years old
- you live in Canada
- you’re a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident of Canada, or a person registered in Canada as an Indian under the Canadian [_Indian Act_](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-5/)
- you have [enough money to support the people you want to sponsor](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1445&top=14)
  - to show that you have enough, you’ll have to provide your [proof of income](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=825&top=14)
  - you may have a spouse or common-law partner co-sign the application to combine your incomes
- you and your parents and grandparents meet all other requirements under the _Immigration and Refugee Protection Act_ and the _Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations_

**Find out if you meet the income requirements**

Before you apply, [find out how much money you need](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1445&top=14) to sponsor your parents and grandparents. You’ll have to prove you have this income in your application.

**If you live outside Quebec**

To become a sponsor, you must commit to financially support the people you’re sponsoring for a period of time. We call this commitment an undertaking.

The undertaking commits you to

- providing financial support for your sponsored family members for **20 years**, starting when they become permanent residents
- repaying any provincial social assistance (money from the government) your sponsored family members get during that time

Also, you and your sponsored family members need to agree to certain responsibilities during the undertaking period. We call this the sponsorship agreement.

The sponsorship agreement means that

- you’ll provide for the basic needs of your sponsored family members, including
  - food
  - clothing
  - utilities
  - personal requirements
  - shelter
  - fuel
  - household supplies
  - health care not covered by public health insurance, such as eye and dental care
- the person you sponsor will make every effort to support themselves and their family members

This agreement is still valid, and you must still cover basic needs for the period it covers, even in the case of

- marriage ending, separation or divorce
- family rifts
- unemployment
- change in finances
- death of the principal applicant, if you also sponsor their family members

When you apply, you’ll have to complete and sign a form that includes the undertaking and the sponsorship agreement.

**If you live in Quebec**

You must meet [Quebec’s immigration sponsorship requirements](https://www.quebec.ca/en/immigration/sponsor-family-member/sponsoring-father-mother-great-parent/conditions-sponsor-parents) after we approve you as a sponsor. The Quebec ministry in charge of immigration will [assess your income](https://www.quebec.ca/en/immigration/sponsor-family-member/calculating-income).

If we approve you as a sponsor, we’ll send you information on what to do next.

You must also sign an [undertaking](https://www.quebec.ca/en/immigration/sponsor-family-member/sponsoring-father-mother-great-parent/undertaking-application) with the province of Quebec. The length of the undertaking is 10 years for Quebec.

**Who can’t sponsor a parent or grandparent**

You can’t sponsor your parents and grandparents if

- you haven’t been invited to apply
- you’re less than 18 years old
- you won’t live in Canada when you apply to sponsor your parents and grandparents and/or when your parents and grandparents become permanent residents
  - Your primary residential address must be in Canada when you submit your application and until we make a decision on your application.
- you’re not a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident of Canada or a person registered in Canada as an Indian under the Canadian [_Indian Act_](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-5/)

- your permanent residence application is still in process
  - You must have permanent resident status at the time you submit your sponsorship application
- your [proof of income](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=825&top=14) shows you don’t have [enough money to support the people you want to sponsor](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1445&top=14)

You may **not** be eligible to sponsor your parents and grandparents if you

- are in jail, prison or penitentiary
- **didn’t** pay back
  - an immigration loan
  - a performance bond
  - court-ordered family support payments such as alimony or child support [<sup>Footnote\*</sup>](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/sponsor-parents-grandparents/eligibility.html#fn*)
- didn’t give the financial support you agreed to when you signed a sponsorship agreement to sponsor someone else in the past[<sup>Footnote\*</sup>](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/sponsor-parents-grandparents/eligibility.html#fn*)
- declared bankruptcy and are not [discharged](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br02677.html) [<sup>Footnote\*</sup>](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/sponsor-parents-grandparents/eligibility.html#fn*)
- receive social assistance for a reason other than a disability

- can’t legally stay in Canada and must leave the country because you received a [Removal Order](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/security-securite/rem-ren-eng.html)

There may be other reasons that make you ineligible to sponsor your parents and grandparents. If we determine you’re not eligible to sponsor, we’ll tell you why.

**Who you can sponsor**

You can sponsor your own parents and grandparents, related by blood or adoption.

In case of divorce, you’ll need to submit separate applications if you sponsor divorced parents and grandparents. If your divorced parents or grandparents have a current spouse, common-law partner or a conjugal partner, these people become dependants on the application and can immigrate to Canada with your parents and grandparents, if approved.

In the application, you can include your brothers and sisters, half-brothers and half-sisters, or step-brothers and step-sisters **only if** they qualify as [dependent children](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/immigrate/sponsor/aod-tool.asp).

You must meet the [income requirements](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1445&top=14) for **all** the people you want to sponsor and their dependants (spouse, partner and dependent children).

**The people you sponsor must also be eligible**

To show they meet the eligibility requirements, your parents and grandparents and their dependants must provide

- all required forms and documents with their application
- any additional information we request during processing, including
  - [medical exams](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-permanent-residents.html#when)
  - [police certificates](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/police-certificates.html)
  - [biometrics](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/campaigns/biometrics/facts.html)

**Examples of who you can sponsor**

See the examples below to better understand who you can sponsor.

**Sponsoring your mother and father, together as a couple**

**Sponsoring your father, your stepmother and their son**

**Sponsoring your grandparents, your mother and your stepfather**

**Who you can’t sponsor**

You can’t sponsor

- your spouse’s parents and grandparents (your in-laws)
  - however, you can be a [co-signer](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-5772-application-sponsor-parents-grandparents.html#co-signer) on your in-laws’ application
- someone who is [inadmissible](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/inadmissibility.html) to Canada (someone who is not allowed to come to Canada)

If you’d like your parents and grandparents to come to Canada, they may be eligible to apply for a [super visa](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/parent-grandparent-super-visa/eligibility.html) which could let them stay in Canada for 5 years at a time.

Parents and grandparents visiting on a super visa can also apply for 2-year extensions to their stay while still in Canada.

**How to apply**

**If you’re invited to apply** to sponsor your parents and grandparents, there are 2 applications:

1. You must apply to become a sponsor.

[**Check application processing times**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html)

**The 2023 intake is closed**

For the 2023 intake, we invited potential sponsors from the remaining pool of interest to sponsor forms submitted in 2020.

Between October 10 and 23, 2023, we sent 24,200 invitations to apply. The deadline to submit your application has now passed.

**We aren’t accepting any more applications for the 2023 intake.**

**Step 1. Get an invitation to apply**

We randomly select and invite potential sponsors who submitted interest to sponsor forms to apply to sponsor their parents and grandparents.

**Step 2. Fill out the application online**

If you’re invited to apply, the principal applicant (or your representative) must apply online using the

- [Permanent Residence (PR) Portal](https://prson-srpel.apps.cic.gc.ca/en/login) (if you’re applying by yourself)
- [Representative Permanent Residence (PR) Portal](https://prson-srpel.apps.cic.gc.ca/en/rep/login) (if you’re using a representative)

**Note:** If more than one parent or grandparent is applying on their own as principal applicants, they must create their own portal account and electronically sign their own application.

Don’t start filling out your application unless [you’re invited](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/sponsor-parents-grandparents/selected.html) to apply. **If you apply without being invited, we**

- **will return your application and**
- **won’t refund the sponsorship application processing fee**

If you live in Quebec, find out the steps to take to [sponsor your parents and grandparents in Quebec](https://www.quebec.ca/en/immigration/sponsor-family-member/sponsoring-father-mother-great-parent).

**Documents you’ll need for your application**

- [Documents for the sponsor](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/sponsor-parents-grandparents/apply.html#details-panel1)
- [Documents for the person being sponsored](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/sponsor-parents-grandparents/apply.html#details-panel2)

**Before you submit your application**

You (**the sponsor**) must download and fill out these PDF forms:

- [Document Checklist — Sponsor \[IMM 5771\] (PDF, 1 MB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5771e.pdf)

The person you’re sponsoring (principal applicant) will

**Tips for downloading and filling out the PDF forms**

- Make sure you have **Adobe Reader 10 or higher** and **JavaScript** is turned on. If you have trouble downloading, right-click the link and choose “Save target as...”
- Fill out the form on your computer instead of by hand. It’s easier and reduces mistakes that can cause delays. Printing can reduce the quality of the forms, which can also cause delays.
- **Complete, sign** and **date** your application forms.

Use the [Instruction Guide \[IMM 5772\]](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-5772-application-sponsor-parents-grandparents.html) to help you fill out the forms properly.

**If you need help applying**

**How to find your Canadian citizenship information**

If you’re a Canadian citizen, to sponsor your parents or grandparents, you need

- the date you became a Canadian citizen
- your [unique client identifier (UCI)](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=013&top=4) or client ID number

To find the date and the number, check the **back** of your [citizenship certificate](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/proof-citizenship/documents.html#_The_citizenship_certificate).

If you **don’t** have your citizenship certificate, you can apply for a

- [citizenship certificate urgently](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/proof-citizenship/apply/urgently.html)
- [search of citizenship records urgently](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/proof-citizenship/search-records.html)

If you can’t get proof of your citizenship by the due date indicated on your invitation to apply letter, you can include an explanation letter saying

- why you don’t have it and
- what steps you’ve taken to get it

**Step 3. Pay your application fees**

**Fees: from $1,080**

You have to [pay your fees online(opens in a new tab)](https://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/information/fees/pay.asp) .

<table><tbody><tr><th><p><strong>Processing fees</strong></p></th><th><p>You need to pay processing fees for you, the people you’re sponsoring and their dependants.</p></th></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Right of permanent residence fee</strong></p></td><td><p>In most cases, you need to pay the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/information/fees/fees.asp#rprf">right of permanent residence fee</a>&nbsp;<strong>when your application is approved.</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Biometrics fee</strong></p></td><td><p>In most cases, you’ll pay a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/campaigns/biometrics/facts.html">biometrics</a>&nbsp;fee&nbsp;<strong>when you submit your application.</strong>&nbsp;If you don’t, your application may be delayed.</p><p>This fee covers the cost of collecting fingerprints and a digital photo.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Third-party fees</strong></p></td><td><p>Depending on your situation, you may need to pay third parties for</p><ul><li>your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams.html">medical exam</a></li><li>a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/police-certificates.html">police certificate</a></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

The [instruction guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-5772-application-sponsor-parents-grandparents.html) can help you understand which fees apply to you.

**Step 4. Submit your online application**

Before you submit your application, make sure you

- answer all questions on the forms
- electronically sign your application (type your full name exactly as shown on your passport)
- include your processing fee receipt
- upload all the supporting documents
  - upload a copy of your invitation to apply letter for the 2023 intake under the section “Required documents” in your online application

If your application is incomplete, we’ll send you a request letter to submit any missing documents. You’ll have 30 days to submit the missing documents.

Follow the instructions in this letter to submit the missing documentation. If your application is still incomplete after 30 days, we’ll return the application to you and it won’t be processed.

**Step 5. Send us additional information during processing**

During processing, the person you’re sponsoring must submit their

- [medical exams](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-permanent-residents.html#when)
- [police certificates](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/police-certificates.html)
- [biometrics](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/campaigns/biometrics/facts.html) within 30 days of receiving the biometric instruction letter

**If the people you’re are sponsoring can’t give their biometrics on time**

Book a biometric collection appointment as soon as you receive the biometric instruction letter to avoid processing delays. If the people you’re sponsoring can’t give biometrics within 30 days, use the [web form](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc/web-form.html) to tell us why they need more time.

**Get updates about your application**

If you and the person you’re sponsoring meet the eligibility requirements, we’ll mail or email you a request to link your application to an online account so you can get updates on the progress of your application.

**After you apply**

**Keep your information up to date**

To avoid delays in processing, make sure your contact information and your application details are up to date.

Use our [web form](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc/web-form2.html) to tell us of changes in your application, such as

- the birth or adoption of a child
- the death of an applicant or dependant
- contact information updates, including
  - email

**Don’t mail us changes to your contact or application information.** If you do, we won’t acknowledge your request and we won’t update your application. This could lead to a delay in processing your application.

**How we process your application**

We’ll review your sponsorship application and return it to you if

During processing, track your application and make sure it’s up to date by

**Check the status of your application**

**For sponsors**

Sponsors can check the status of their application by using our [online tool](https://services3.cic.gc.ca/ecas/security.do?lang=en). You can do this after we start processing your application and we’ll send you a letter with your application number. This can also take several weeks or even months. Unfortunately, we can’t give an exact time because every case is different.

Our telephone and social media agents also won’t be able to tell you the date you’ll get the letter with your application number. They don’t have this information.

**If you want to manage your parents’ and grandparents’ application for them**

As the sponsor, if you want to check on your parents’ and/or grandparents’ application status, you must first [request access to their information](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/sponsor-parents-grandparents/after-apply-next-steps.html#application-help).

To protect your parents’ and grandparents’ privacy, they need to give us their written consent before we’ll share any of their personal information with you, or give anyone access to their application information.

Find out how the people you’re sponsoring can [give you access to their information](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigration-citizenship-representative/application-access.html).

You can ask for permission just to check their status, or you can ask to act as what we call a “[representative](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigration-citizenship-representative/learn-about-representatives.html)” if you want to

- fill out and submit your parents’ and grandparents’ application for them
- communicate with us on their behalf

To become your parents’ and grandparents’ representative, you must complete, sign and save the [use of a representative form (PDF, 264 KB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5476e.pdf) to add or change a representative and include it with your application. The people you’re sponsoring must also sign the form.

If you’ve already submitted your sponsorship application, send it to us through our [web form](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc/web-form2.html). Include your

- full name
- date of birth
- country of birth
- application number (if you know it)
- [UCI](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=013&top=4) (if you know it)

Upload the form after you’ve completed all the required fields.

**For the people being sponsored**

The people you’re sponsoring can check their application in 2 ways. They can

- [create an IRCC secure online account](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/account.html) and [link their application](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/account/link-paper-online.html) to it
  - This includes either **a paper application** or one submitted online through the Permanent Residence Portal.
  - They can do this **only when** [we’ve started processing](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/sponsor-parents-grandparents/after-apply-next-steps.html#approved) their application and we’ve sent them their application number
- use the [online tool](https://services3.cic.gc.ca/ecas/security.do?app=ecas&lang=en), which is updated daily

**Linking the parent and/or grandparent application to an online account**

When we start processing your family members’ application, we’ll send them a letter with their application number.

It can take several weeks or even months to get this letter. Unfortunately, we can’t give an exact time because every case is different. Our telephone and social media agents also won’t be able to tell you the date when your family member(s) will get the letter.

After they get this letter, the principal applicant can link their application to their online account. This way, they can communicate with us quickly and securely and get updates and messages about their application online.

Find out [how to create an online account and link an application](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/account/link-paper-online.html).

**You (the sponsor) can link their application for them if you’re** [**managing your family members’ application**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/sponsor-parents-grandparents/after-apply-next-steps.html#application-help) **and you’re designated as their representative.**

See the [top questions about linking your application](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/results-by-topic.asp?st=23.4).

**If your processing time has passed**

If the [normal processing time](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html) for your application has passed, you can contact us using our [web form](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc/web-form2.html).

**Withdraw your sponsorship application**

You can withdraw your sponsorship application any time **before** the person you’re sponsoring becomes a permanent resident of Canada.

You may be able to [get a refund](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=353&top=14) if we haven’t started processing your application.

Use our [web form](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc/web-form2.html) to request the withdrawal of your sponsorship application.

In your request, include your

- full name
- date of birth
- country of birth
- application number (if you know it)
- [UCI](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=013&top=4) (if you know it)
- signed withdrawal request letter

**Submit your right of permanent residence fee or request a refund**

The right of permanent residence fee must be paid before the people you’re sponsoring can become permanent residents. If it wasn’t paid at the time of application, we’ll contact the people you’re sponsoring to explain how they can [pay the right of permanent residence fee online](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/information/fees/index.asp).

You can request a refund for the right of permanent residence fee if

- you’re withdrawing your sponsorship
- your parent or grandparent was refused
  - We can only issue refunds once you decline your right of appeal.

To send us the proof of payment or to request a refund, use our [web form](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc/web-form2.html). In your request, include your

- full name
- date of birth

- copy of the official receipt
- copy of signed right of appeal letter (if you have one)
- letter of explanation if you’re requesting a refund

**Don’t** send the same request more than once. It’ll delay the processing of your refund.

**Prepare for arrival**

When your sponsored family members arrive at the port of entry to Canada, they must show the border services officer their:

- Confirmation of Permanent Residence
  - this is the document we sent when we approved their application
- valid passport or travel document
- permanent resident visa (if we issued you one), which must be valid
- Quebec Selection Certificate, if they’re going to live in Quebec
- any other document we issued to you and told you to bring with you

**If your family members are already in Canada**

They’ll have to meet an immigration officer to receive their permanent residence. We call this a landing interview. We’ll send them instructions about what documents to bring with them, and the time and place of their interview.

**What happens at the border**

The border officer will:

- check that your permanent resident visa and Confirmation of Permanent Residence haven’t expired
- ask your family members to confirm information that they gave in their application

Your sponsored family members must tell the officer of any funds they’re bringing into Canada, including:

- cash
- stocks
- bonds
- money orders
- traveller’s cheques

Get more information on the [documents your parents and grandparents need](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/prepare-life-canada/border-entry.html) and the [interview process](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/prepare-life-canada/border-entry/interviews.html) when crossing the Canadian border.

If satisfied that they meet the requirements to enter Canada, the officer will:

- allow them to enter Canada as a [permanent residents](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card/understand-pr-status.html)
- start the process to mail their permanent resident card to the address on their Confirmation of Permanent Residence
  - [Make sure their Canadian address is correct](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card/canadian-address.html).
