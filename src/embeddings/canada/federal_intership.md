- policy and research
- computer science

Through the FIN Program, candidates are hired as [temporary employees](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/staffing/public-service-workforce/casual-worker.html) and gain experience in

- understanding job application and hiring processes
- Canadian workplace culture
- networking with professionals
- attending training sessions

Each participant is matched with a public service mentor.

## **Extend your work permit**

How to work longer in Canada as a temporary worker or a live-in caregiver and how to get a bridging work permit.

**Extend your participation or change your work permit**

You can only extend your participation or make changes to your International Experience Canada (IEC) work permit in very specific situations.

**My job has been extended**

You can apply to extend your IEC participation if:

- you’re a Young Professional or International Co-op (Internship) participant
- you’ll be working for the same employer at the same location
- your job duties won’t change
- your original offer of employment was for a shorter amount of time than [you’re eligible](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/work/iec/eligibility.asp) for, and
- your new offer of employment does not put you over the maximum amount of time that you’re eligible for
  - for example, if you’re eligible to work in Canada for 12 months and your first work permit was valid for 6 months, your new work permit can only be valid for a maximum of 6 more months.

You **can’t** extend your participation if you want to work for the same employer but in a different job or at a different address.

**Fees**

You don’t have to pay a new IEC or work permit fee.

In your letter of explanation, make sure you tell us that you’re fee exempt because you’re applying to extend your IEC participation.

**How to extend your participation**

You must submit a paper application. **Do not submit your application online.**

**Before** you submit your application to extend your participation, your employer must [submit a new offer of employment](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/partners-service-providers/employer-portal.html) and pay the employer compliance fee.

1. Complete the [work permit application](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/extend/alternate-format.html?paper)
2. Include a letter of explanation telling us:
   - that you’re an International Experience Canada participant
   - you’re applying to extend your participation
   - you’re fee exempt, and
   - the reason why you’re applying to extend
3. **Mail** your completed application to the address below.

Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada  
c/o Work Permit- IEC Station 404  
Suite 55 9700 Jasper Avenue NW  
Edmonton AB T5J 4C3

If your work permit expires before we process your application, you’re authorized to

- stay in Canada **and**
- work under the **same conditions** of your original work permit until we process your application

You can only apply for an extension **once** per IEC participation.

If your application is approved the expiry date of your new work permit will match whichever comes first, the:

- expiry date of your passport
- expiry date of your healthcare insurance, or
- end date of your offer of employment

**I want to change employers**

If you have a work permit under the **Working Holiday** category, you have an [open work permit](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/glossary.asp#open_work_permit). This means that **you can change employers** whenever you want or need to.

Under the Young Professionals and International Co-op (Internship) categories, you can only change your employer if you have a valid reason. Your new job must still meet the requirements of the [Young Professionals or International Co-op categories](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/work/iec/eligibility.asp).

Examples of valid reasons to change your employer include:

- you were working for a company that has closed
- you’re not receiving the wages you were promised
- your working conditions are not safe or as promised, or
- you have been fired or laid off

You **can’t** change your employer because:

- you’ve been offered better wages by a different employer
- you would like to work in a different location, or
- you do not like your job or employer

If you’re not eligible to change employers and stay in the IEC program, you may be eligible to apply for a different [type of work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/work-permit-types.html).

**How to change employers**

1. Submit a request using the [Web form](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/contacts/web-form.asp).
2. Select “International Experience Canada” in the “Type of Application” drop-down menu.
3. Clearly explain the reasons why you need to change your employer and how your new job contributes to your professional development or studies.
4. Submit supporting documents to prove your claim.
5. Include a letter of offer from your new employer.

Your request to change employers will be assessed. If you have a valid reason and are still eligible for IEC, you will receive instructions on how to submit a new work permit application.

In some cases, we may need to involve law enforcement agencies to investigate your employer.

Your new work permit will only be valid for the time remaining on your current IEC work permit. For example, if you request a change three months into a 12-month approved stay, your new work permit will be valid for a maximum of 9 months. The 2 work permits will count as a single participation, even if you do not use the new work permit.

**The expiry date on my work permit is wrong**

You can only extend your participation if the expiry date on your work permit is wrong because **we** made an error.

You can’t extend your participation if, when you entered Canada, you didn’t have healthcare insurance for the **entire duration** of:

- your offer of employment, or
- the maximum length of stay listed in the agreement between Canada and your country

Your original work permit would not have been valid beyond the expiry date of your health insurance.

**Fees**

There are no fees to correct an error **we** made.

In your letter of explanation, make sure you tell us that you’re fee exempt because you’re applying to extend your IEC participation.

**How to extend your participation**

You must submit a paper application. **Do not submit your application online.**

**I need to remove medical restrictions**

You need to remove medical restrictions if you

- have received a work permit **or** port of entry letter
- have not passed a medical exam **and**
- now want to work in a job that requires a medical exam

There are 2 ways to do this, depending on whether or not you’ve already arrived in Canada.

**If you have a port of entry letter and haven’t left your country of residence**

- Get an [upfront medical exam](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents.html), which means that you are getting a medical exam before you have been asked to do so by a visa officer.
- Bring proof that you have undergone the medical exam and give it to the border services officer when you enter Canada. The border services officer will be able to adjust the conditions on your work permit.

**If you have a work permit and are already in Canada**

- Get an [upfront medical exam](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents.html), which means that you are getting a medical exam before you have been asked to do so by a visa officer.
- Complete an [application to change the conditions on your work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/extend/alternate-format.html?paper).
  - You must submit a paper application. **Do not submit your application online**.
- Include a letter of explanation that asks to have the limiting conditions removed from your work permit.
  - **For example**: not authorized to work in child care, primary or secondary school, health service field occupations
- [Pay the open work permit holder fee](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/inFORMation/fees/index.asp) (if you are a Working Holiday participant).
  - You don’t need to pay the work permit processing fee or an IEC fee.
- **Mail** your completed application to

Case Processing Centre Edmonton  
Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada  
c/o Work Permit – IEC Station 404

You must submit a paper application. **Do not submit your application online**.

If your work permit expires before we process your application, you can keep working in Canada until you receive a decision on your application. This is known as [maintained status](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1476).

**I’ve extended my health insurance**

If your health insurance was going to expire while you were still in Canada and you didn’t receive the maximum length of stay listed in the [agreement between Canada and your country](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/work/iec/eligibility.asp), you’re **not** able to apply to extend your work permit, **even if you extend your health insurance after entering Canada**.

It’s your responsibility to make sure you have adequate health insurance for the entire length of your stay in Canada **before** arriving in the country.

**What to do when you’re not eligible to extend your International Experience Canada work permit**

You can only extend your work permit if:

- your job has been extended
- you want to change employers
- the expiry date on your work permit is wrong
- you’ve received a new passport, or
- you need to remove medical restrictions

If this doesn’t apply to you and you want to stay in Canada as a worker, you have two options.

**Option 1:**

You can submit a new International Experience Canada profile and you may receive another invitation to apply, if

- [you’re eligible](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/work/iec/eligibility.asp) for International Experience Canada, and
- your country of citizenship allows more than one participation.

**Option 2:**

Apply for another [type of work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/work-permit-types.html).

If you apply for a new work permit, you should submit your application at least 30 days before your International Experience Canada work permit expires. This will ensure that you don’t lose [legal status in Canada](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=515&top=15).

If your work permit expires before we process your application, you can keep working in Canada until you receive a decision on your application. This is known as [maintained status](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1476).

If we refuse your application for a new work permit, you must leave Canada before the date indicated on the letter we send you.

- extend your permit’s expiry date
- change the conditions listed on it

The conditions you can apply to change are your

- employer
- job location

You can change employers and stay in the LCP, as long as you and your new employer meet the requirements. [Find out how you can change employers in the LCP](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/caregiver-program/change-employers-eligibility.html).

The date your work permit expires is on the work permit. This is also the date that your temporary status in Canada expires. If your status expires, you must leave Canada. You should apply to extend or change the conditions of your current work permit **at least 30 days before the expiry date.**

If you apply before your work permit expires, you can legally stay in Canada until we process your application. This is called [maintaining your status](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#maintained-status).

You can also continue to work under the **same conditions** of your original work permit until we process your new application.

**If you applied to change the conditions of your work permit**

You can’t start working for a new employer until you get your new work permit. However, you can keep working under the conditions on your original work permit.

We’ll let you know if we approve your application to change your permit.

**If your work permit expires before you apply to extend or change it**

You must apply

- to restore your status as a temporary resident in Canada
- for a **new** work permit

You must do this **within 90 days** of the expiry date on your current work permit. You also need to [pay an extra fee](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/information/fees/fees.asp) to restore your status as a temporary resident in Canada. This means you must pay both the [Restoration of Temporary Resident Status fee](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/information/fees/fees.asp#other) and the regular [work permit](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/information/fees/fees.asp#temporary) fee.

You also need to submit a copy of your employer’s new [Labour Market Impact Assessment](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/caregiver-program/apply-change-employers.html#get) with your work permit application. This is a document your employer must get from Service Canada before they can hire you.

**Get your documents ready**

If you will continue to **work for the same employer**, you must submit these documents with your application:

- a letter from your employer that
  - says you will keep working for them full time
  - lists the last day you will work for them
- a copy of [an updated, or extended, employment contract](https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/content/EForms/en/Detail.html?Form=EMP5604) signed by you and your employer

[Apply to extend or change the conditions on your work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/extend.html)

**Apply for an open work permit at the same time as permanent residence**

If you are applying for permanent residence through the LCP, you can also apply for an open work permit at the same time. An open work permit lets you work for any employer, doing any job you want, for the length of time listed on the permit.

Follow these steps to apply:

**1\. Find out if you are eligible**

To be eligible for an open work permit, you must:

- submit your application for an open work permit and your application for permanent residence at the same time **or**

- processing fees for you and anyone you include on your application
- [biometrics](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/campaigns/biometrics/facts.html)

You can [pay your fees online (opens in a new tab)](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/information/fees/pay.asp).

**Biometrics fee**

In most cases, you must pay a biometrics fee **when you submit your application**. Otherwise you may experience delays. The biometrics fee covers the cost of collecting fingerprints and a digital photo.

After you pay the biometrics fee with a complete application, we’ll send you a letter confirming that you need to give your biometrics and where you can go. You **must show this letter** when you give your biometrics.

You must give your biometrics in person. Make sure to book an appointment if this service is offered. [Find a collection point close to you](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/campaigns/biometrics/where-to-give-biometrics.html).

**Third party fees**

Depending on your situation, you may need to pay third parties for:

- [your medical exams](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams.html)
- [police certificates](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/police-certificates.html)

Our instruction guide can help you understand which fees apply to you.

**4\. Submit your application**

If you are also applying for permanent residence at the same time, send both applications in the same envelope, before your current work permit expires.

Make sure you include:

- your file number
- your full name
- your date of birth
- a letter explaining why you are applying for an open work permit

You must submit your application **at least 30 days** before your current work permit expires. You should also keep a copy of the entire application you submit.

**Quit your job**

Before quitting your job, you should try to solve your work problems by talking about them with your employer, unless there are problems of [abuse](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=242&top=17). You and your employer can revise your contract once in a while to be sure it works for both of you.

Talk with your employer before taking any action to quit your job. If you decide to quit, give your employer enough time to find a replacement for you.

Check your contract to find out how much time you have agreed to give your employer. However, if you are in a situation where there is [abuse](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=242&top=17), you should leave right away.

**You will still need these documents from your employer:**

- a record of any overtime hours you worked; and
- an [ROE](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/ei/ei-list/ei-roe/access-roe.html). The ROE indicates:
  - your reason for leaving
  - hours worked
  - gross earnings
  - any money paid or payable at the time you left your job.

Only your employer can get and complete the ROE. Your employer is legally responsible to give you an ROE and cannot refuse to do so. If you have difficulty getting your ROE, contact your local [ESDC/SC](http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/cgi-bin/hr-search.cgi?app=hme&ln=eng) centre and ask officials to contact your employer.

**Keep your ROE in a safe place. It is your work record and can serve as proof that you have worked the necessary time to** [**apply for permanent resident status**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/caregiver-program/become-permanent-resident.html)**.**

For more information on finding a new live-in caregiver position and obtaining a new work permit, refer to:

- [Changing jobs](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/caregiver-program/extend-change-permit.html#extend)

**Situations of abuse**

If you feel that you have been a victim of abuse in your workplace, you may be eligible for the emergency processing of a new Live-in Caregiver Program work permit to help you transition to a new employer as quickly as possible.

Contact the [Call Centre](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc/client-support-centre.html) to confirm the eligibility and application requirements for emergency processing of live-in caregiver work permits.

**What to do if you lose your job**

If you lose your job and need to apply for Employment Insurance benefits, contact the [ESDC/SC](http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/cgi-bin/hr-search.cgi?app=hme&ln=eng) centre nearest you. You will need your ROE to collect these benefits.

If you have not yet received your ROE, you can still apply for EI. Your employer is legally responsible to give you an ROE and cannot refuse to do so. If you have difficulty getting your ROE, contact your local [ESDC/SC](http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/cgi-bin/hr-search.cgi?app=hme&ln=eng) centre and ask officials to contact your employer.

**Keep your ROE in a safe place. It is your work record and can serve as proof that you have worked the necessary time to** [**apply for permanent resident status**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/caregiver-program/become-permanent-resident.html)**.**

You will be expected to find a new employer as soon as possible. For more information on finding a new employer and obtaining a new work permit, see:

- [Changing jobs](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/caregiver-program/extend-change-permit.html#extend)

Periods of unemployment will delay the date on which you can apply for permanent resident status.

**Bridging open work permit for permanent residence applicants**

A bridging open work permit (BOWP) lets you keep working while you wait for the results of your permanent residence application.

You may be eligible if you applied to one of the permanent residence programs below.

## **How to report abuse of temporary foreign workers**

**Your rights are protected**

All workers in Canada are protected under Canadian law.

Canada takes the abuse of temporary foreign workers (TFW) and the TFW Program (TFWP) very seriously. Employers who abuse workers or the TFWP could face a penalty or be banned from the program. If you or someone you know has experienced abuse, you can report it to Service Canada.

Examples of abuse:

- someone is threatening, bullying or abusing you
- someone is threatening your status in Canada
- you’re not allowed to leave your work site or where you live
- someone is keeping your passport or documents from you
- you’re not receiving your correct pay or time off
