To be eligible for permanent residence under this public policy, you must apply from within Canada.

**Step 1: Get ready to apply online**

**You must now apply online**

As of January 9, 2023, you need to apply online.

If you can’t apply online and need accommodations, including for a disability, you can ask for the application in [another format](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/how-to-apply-online.html#alternative) (paper, braille or large print).

Sign in or create a [**Permanent residence online application portal account**](https://prson-srpel.apps.cic.gc.ca/en/login) (opens in a new tab).

Refer to the [Instruction Guide \[IMM 5067\]](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-5067-hong-kong-permanent-residence-pathways.html) for important information about your eligibility, fees and how to apply.

**Step 2: Fill out your forms**

**You must fill out these digital forms online**

You’ll fill out these digital forms online (for yourself, and any family members 18 or older)

- Generic Application Form for Canada \[IMM 0008\]
- Schedule A – Background/Declaration \[IMM 5669\]
- Additional Family Information \[IMM 5406\]
- Supplementary Information – Your Travels \[IMM 5562\]

**You must also fill out these PDF forms**

  - [Document checklist \[IMM 0134\] (PDF, 0.9 MB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/kits/forms/imm0134e.pdf)
    - Use this checklist to make sure you include all the forms and documents you need.

**If you’re applying under stream A (In-Canada graduates)**

- [Schedule 7A – Permanent residence pathways for Hong Kong residents: Stream A – In-Canada graduates \[IMM 0135\] (PDF, 1.5 MB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/kits/forms/imm0135e.pdf)

**If you’re applying under stream B (Canadian work experience)**

- [Schedule 7B – Permanent residence pathways for Hong Kong residents: Stream B – Canadian work experience \[IMM 0136\] (PDF, 1.5 MB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/kits/forms/imm0136e.pdf)

**Using an immigration representative**

If you’re a representative, [find out how you can create an account and submit applications on behalf of your clients](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigration-citizenship-representative/pr-representatives-online.html).

If you want to appoint someone to do business with us on your behalf, you must

- submit a [Use of a Representative \[IMM 5476\] (PDF, 648.31 KB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5476e.pdf) form
- sign it digitally or by hand and get your immigration representative to do so also
- upload it with your application

An immigration representative (an immigration consultant or lawyer) can give you advice and help you with your application for a fee. But they can’t

- open a portal account on your behalf
- electronically sign the application for you
- sign into the portal using your username and password

A representative can fill out forms and communicate with us on your behalf through their own account. They can also

- help you prepare the documents you need to upload
- answer questions about the forms

After you read the declaration, **you must be the one who types your name**. This is the legal requirement for your application to be considered “signed,” according to Canada’s immigration law.

If you want to allow us to release information from your application to someone other than yourself who will not act as your representative you must

- submit an [Authority to Release Personal Information to a Designated Individual \[IMM 5475\] (PDF, 593.57 KB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5475e.pdf) form

**Photo specifications**

You need one photo for each person on your application.

Follow the instructions in the online application to scan and upload **both sides** of your photo.

If you need to upload a number of images, find out [how to combine them into 1 document](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1160&top=23).

**Step 3: Pay your fees online**

**Our permanent residence fees are increasing**

The fees for all permanent residence applications are increasing on April 30, 2024. [Find out more about how the fees are changing](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/notices/increase-permanent-residence-fees-april-2024.html).

Find out [how to pay your fees](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/information/fees/index.asp).

**Biometrics fee**

In most cases, you must pay a biometrics fee when you **submit your application**. Otherwise, you may experience delays. The biometrics fee covers the cost of collecting fingerprints and a digital photo.

After you pay the biometrics fee with a complete application, we’ll send you a letter confirming that you need to give your biometrics and where you can go. You **must show this letter** when you give your biometrics.

You must give your biometrics in person. Make sure to book an appointment if this service is offered. [Find a collection point close to you](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/campaigns/biometrics/where-to-give-biometrics.html).

**Step 4: Submit your application**

Before you submit your application, make sure you:

- answer all questions
- electronically sign your application (type your full name exactly as shown on your passport)
- include your processing fee receipt
- upload all the supporting documents

If your application is incomplete, we’ll reject it. You’ll have to fix any errors and then re-submit it.

**After you apply**

**How we process your application**

We’ll review your application to make sure

- it’s complete
- you meet all the eligibility requirements
- you paid your fees
- you included all the required documents

Your application may be delayed if

- there are any criminal or security problems, or we need to do more background checks
- your family situation isn’t clear (this could include a divorce, an adoption that isn’t complete or child custody issues that haven’t been resolved)
- the processing office has to contact other IRCC offices in or outside Canada to confirm the information you gave

While your application is in process, you must tell us if you [change your address](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/change-address.html) or [contact information](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/contacts/web-form.asp).

**If your application isn’t complete**

We may return or refuse your application if

- it’s missing any required documents
- you didn’t pay your fees

**If your application is complete**

We’ll ask you, and any family members you include in your application, to

- give your fingerprints and photo ([biometrics](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/campaigns/biometrics/facts.html)), if required
- complete [medical exams](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-permanent-residents.html)

**Get your fingerprints and photo taken**

You and your family members may need to give your fingerprints and photo (biometrics) **after** you apply for permanent residence. [Find out if you need to give your biometrics](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/visit/biometrics.asp).

**Get a medical exam**

**You don’t need to complete a medical exam before you apply.**  
We’ll ask you to complete one after we review your application.

You must complete a [medical exam](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-permanent-residents.html) before you can become a permanent resident of Canada. Your family members must also complete medical exams, even if they’re not coming with you to Canada. You **won’t** be able to sponsor them in the future if they don’t complete these exams.

We won’t approve your application if your health

- is a danger to Canada’s public health or safety
- would cause too much demand on health or social services in Canada

When we ask you to complete your exam, we’ll send you both of the following:

- medical forms for you and any family members you include in your application
- instructions about finding a doctor in your area who is authorized to do immigration medical exams

**If we approve your application**

Make sure you pay your right of permanent residence fee (if you haven’t already).

We’ll contact you to

- give you a confirmation of permanent residence document, which confirms you’ve been approved to become a Canadian permanent resident
- confirm your mailing address in Canada, so we can send you your permanent resident card (PR card)

If you have family members outside Canada, we may also send you permanent resident visas for them (if they need visas to enter Canada).

Find out [what it means to become a permanent resident](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card/understand-pr-status.html).

**If we refuse your application**

We’ll send you a letter that explains why we refused your application.
