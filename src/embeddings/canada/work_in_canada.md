**About the process**

Most foreign nationals need a work permit to work in Canada.

[Answer a few questions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/need-permit.html) if you’re not sure if you need a work permit or which one you should get.

There are 2 types of work permits.

**Employer-specific work permit**

An **employer-specific work permit** lets you work in Canada according to the conditions on your work permit, such as

- the name of the specific employer you can work for
- how long you can work
- the location where you can work (if applicable)

Before you apply for an employer-specific work permit, your employer must give you

- a copy of your employment contract
- 1 of the following:
  - a copy of a [labour market impact assessment](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=163&top=17) (LMIA)
  - an offer of employment number (for LMIA-exempt workers)
    - To get this number, your employer must use the [Employer Portal](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/partners-service-providers/employer-portal.html).

**If your employer doesn’t need to use the Employer Portal**

If your employer [does not need to use the Employer Portal](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/hire-temporary-foreign/find-need-labour-market-impact-assessment/employer-compliance-exemptions.html) to submit an offer of employment, they must give you a copy of the employment contract.

**Open work permit**

An **open work permit** lets you work for any employer in Canada, except for one that

- is listed as ineligible on the [list of employers who have failed to comply with the conditions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/employers-non-compliant.html), or
- regularly offers striptease, erotic dance, escort services or erotic massages
  - You can only get an open work permit in [specific situations](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/work-permit.html#centred-popup10).

Some jobs require a medical exam. If you [don’t want medical conditions on your open work permit](https://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1647&top=17), you can get a medical exam from a panel physician.

**If you want to bring your family with you**

Your [spouse](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#spouse) or [common-law partner](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#common_law_partner) and dependent children may be able to work, study or live with you while you work in Canada.

**Eligibility requirements if you apply when you enter Canada at a port of entry**

However, you can apply for a work permit when you enter Canada if you’re eligible.

To apply at a port of entry (POE), you must meet **all** of the following:

To give your biometrics at a POE, you must meet 2 requirements:

- be eligible to apply for a work permit at a POE

Eligible applicants can give their biometrics at these [POE locations](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/eligibility.html#centred-popup).

**How to apply**

You need to apply online for a work permit.

**After you apply**

**If you’re outside Canada**

**Your fingerprints and photo (biometrics)**

Book your biometrics collection appointment as soon as you can to avoid processing delays. [Find out how to give biometrics](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/campaigns/biometrics/how-to-give-biometrics.html).

**How we process your application**

We’ll check your application to make sure you have all the necessary documents, including biometrics.

If it’s incomplete, we’ll return your application without processing it.

An officer will also check

- the list of [employers who failed to comply with the conditions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/employers-non-compliant.html) to make sure that the employer can hire you, and
- that you qualify for a work permit

We may also ask you to

- go to an interview with our officials in your country, or
- send more information or documents

Our online application system uses [coordinated universal time](https://time.is/UTC) (UTC). If we ask you to [upload documents in your account](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1310&top=23), you must submit them before midnight UTC on the date the officer gives you. Make sure you know the difference between your local time and UTC.

You might need a [medical exam](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams.html) to enter Canada. If you do, an officer will tell you and will send you instructions on what to do. A medical exam can add over 3 months to the time it takes us to process your application.

**There’s a new way to check your application status**

Use the [application status tracker(opens in a new tab)](https://ircc-tracker-suivi.apps.cic.gc.ca/en) to get updates about your application. To create an account you need your

- [unique client identifier](https://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=013&top=4) (UCI)
- [application number](https://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1521&top=4)

**Processing time**

[Varies by country](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html)

**If your work permit application is approved**

You’ll get an approval letter that says you’re allowed to work in Canada. This letter is called the port of entry letter of introduction.

You should bring this letter with you when you travel to Canada and present it at the port of entry. This letter is not your work permit.

You’ll only get your work permit at the port of entry the day you arrive in Canada.

The work permit will outline

- the type of work you can do
- the employer you can work for
- where you can work
- how long you can work

**If you’re in Canada**

**How we process your application**

We’ll check your application to make sure you have provided all the necessary documents, including biometrics if required.

If it’s incomplete, we’ll return your application without processing it.

An officer will also check

- the list of [employers who failed to comply with the conditions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/employers-non-compliant.html) to make sure that the employer can hire you, and
- that you qualify for a work permit

Depending on the type of work you’ll be doing, you might need a [medical exam](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams.html). If you do, an officer will tell you and will send you instructions on what to do. A medical exam can add over 3 months to the time it takes us to process your application.

We may also ask you to send more information.

**If you’re a visitor who is applying for a work permit in Canada and held a valid work permit in the last 12 months**

You can ask to be allowed to work **while we process your application.**

**Who’s eligible**

- be physically present in Canada when you apply
  - You must stay in Canada while we process your application. If you leave while your application is being processed, you won’t be eligible under this public policy.
- be a visitor with valid status **when you apply** for the work permit
  - if your **visitor** status has expired, you’ll need to [restore your **visitor** status](https://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1250) before you apply for a work permit
- applied for an employer-specific work permit between August 24, 2020, and February 28, 2025
- have held a work permit that was valid in the 12 months before you applied for a new work permit

**How to get authorization to work while you wait**

Follow these steps.

**Step 1: Contact us**

After you [apply](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/apply.html), fill out the [IRCC Web form](https://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/contacts/web-form.asp?v1).

When you fill out the **Your enquiry** section, you must **copy the text** below.

Message to request interim authorization to work

Make sure you fill out the sections in square brackets, including the

- dates
- work permit number (begins with a “U”)
- name of your employer
- title of your job

If you applied on paper and don’t know your application number, include your courier tracking number. This will ensure we can find your application.

If you have other questions, you need to fill out a new IRCC Web form.

**Step 2: Wait for us to contact you**

You must wait for us to email you to let you know that you can start working. This may take up to 30 **business** days (6 weeks).

**Prepare for arrival**

**Prepare your documents**

When you arrive in Canada, you must have

- your passport
- your visitor visa ([if you need one](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/visit/visas.asp))
- any travel document(s) you’re carrying

You may also need to show proof that your work permit application was approved. One way to do this is to show the border services officer your port of entry [letter of introduction](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=845&top=25). You’ll get this letter if you

- applied online or
- gave us an email address in the work permit application form for communicating with you

You can print this letter or bring an electronic version with you.

You should also bring supporting documents, such as

- proof that you meet the requirements of the job, such as proof of work experience and education
- a copy of your employer’s positive labour market impact assessment (LMIA), if required
  - You’ll also need a copy of your attestation of issuance of your Quebec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ), if your employer needed an LMIA and you’ll work in Quebec.
- the offer of employment number your employer received when they submitted the offer of employment through the Employer Portal (if you are LMIA exempt and coming to work for a specific employer)

**When you arrive in Canada**

**We check your identity**

We check your identity to make sure that you’re the same person who was approved to travel to Canada.

- **If you enter Canada at certain Canadian airports**
  - your fingerprints will be checked automatically at a [primary inspection kiosk](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/services/border-tech-frontiere/pik-bip-eng.html)
  - the system will check your identity against the information collected when your application was submitted
- **If you enter Canada at smaller airports and all land ports of entry**
  - your fingerprints may be checked if we refer you to a [secondary inspection](http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/pub/bsf5146-eng.html), where a border services officer will use a fingerprint verification device to check your fingerprints

**You talk to the border services officer**

Tell the [border services officer](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#border_services_officer) that you have come here to work and show the documents you brought with you.

You won’t be allowed into Canada if you give false or incomplete information.

You must also

- convince the officer that
  - you meet [Canada’s entry requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/prepare-arrival.html#centred-popup)
  - you’ll leave Canada at the end of your approved stay
- have [valid immigration medical exam results](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents.html#long) ([if you needed an exam](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents/country-requirements.html))
  - Your results must be valid the day you enter Canada.
  - You need to [get another medical exam](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents.html) if your results will expire before you enter Canada.

The officer makes the **final decision to issue you a work permit and allow you to enter Canada.**

**We print your work permit**

Once the border services officer has checked your documents and confirms that you can enter Canada, the officer will print the actual work permit for you. If you have questions, or there’s a mistake on your work permit, ask the officer before you leave.

Your passport must be valid for longer than the time you plan to be in Canada. Your work permit won’t be valid beyond your passport’s expiry date. This does not apply to citizens of the United States who show a valid United States passport to the border services officer.

**Medical and health insurance, and workers’ compensation in Canada**

The eligibility rules for public health insurance vary by province and territory. Make sure that you and any dependants coming with you to Canada **either** have enough

- health care insurance
- money in case you need medical attention

You can find more information from the ministry of health of the province or territory where you plan to work.

## **Extend or change the conditions on your work permit**

**About the process**

If you have a work permit that’s about to expire or that you need to change, you must apply to extend it or change the conditions on it.

You should apply to extend your work permit **at least 30 days** before your current permit expires.

[Quebec investors: Extend your open work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/open-work-permit-quebec-investor/extend.html)

**Maintain your status**

If you apply to extend or change the conditions of your work permit before it expires, you’re legally allowed to stay in Canada while we process your application.

If your work permit expires while we process your application, [find out if you can keep working](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/extend/expired-permit.html).

**Date and time we receive your application**

To maintain your status, we must receive your application **before** your work permit expires. We determine the date and time an application is received 2 ways:

1. **If you apply online:** You must submit your application before midnight UTC on the day your work permit expires.
   - Our online application system uses [coordinated universal time](https://time.is/UTC) (UTC).
   - Make sure you know the difference between your local time and UTC.
2. **If you apply on paper:** We stamp paper applications the day we receive them at the case processing centre.
   - If we receive an application after your work permit expires, we’ll count back 7 days and use that as the date received.

**Check the expiry date on your passport**

You can’t extend your work permit [beyond the expiry date of your passport](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1504&top=15). Make sure your passport won’t expire before the requested end date of your permit.

**If you don’t have a work permit**

If you want to work in Canada temporarily, [find out what you need to do](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/work-permit.html).

**If you want to stay in Canada permanently**

You must qualify under one of the [permanent resident categories](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada.html).

**Who can apply**

This application is for you if you

- want to extend your work permit
- need to make changes to the conditions on your work permit, such as
  - the type of work you can do
  - the employer you can work for
  - where you can work
    - This includes restrictions because [you needed a medical exam](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents.html#needs). For instance, you received an open work permit with restrictions on working in health care because you hadn’t completed a medical exam.

**Employer-specific work permits**

You need to apply to extend or change the conditions of your work permit if:

- your job is extended
- there are changes to your current job, such as:
  - a change in your pay
  - new responsibilities
- you’re offered a different job
- you want to work for a new employer

You can’t start working at a different job or for a new employer until you get your work permit with the new conditions.

**Open work permits**

If you have an open work permit, you may be able to extend it as long as you’re still [eligible to work in Canada with an open work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/extend/eligibility.html#centred-popup10).

**How to apply**

Before you apply, make sure your employer has [completed all the required steps](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/hire-temporary-foreign/extend-permit.html).

**If you need to leave Canada and plan to return**

If your visitor visa expired, you need to [apply for a new visitor visa](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/apply-new-temporary-resident-visa-within-canada.html) before you’ll be able to travel back to Canada. You don’t automatically get a new visa when you apply to extend or change your work permit.

In most cases, you must apply online to extend or change the conditions on your work permit.

**How applying online helps you**

- You can make sure your [application is complete](http://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=072&top=3) before you submit it.
- You’ll get a [letter (WP-EXT except PGWP) that proves you can keep working](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/extend/apply.html#centred-popup3) under the **same conditions as your current work permit**.
  - You won’t get this if you apply on paper because we won’t know if your application is complete until we review it.
- No courier fees or mail delivery time — we get your application instantly.
- You can quickly submit more documents online (if we ask you to).
- You get updates on the status of your application directly in your online account.

**Step 1: Make sure you have what you need**

To apply online, you’ll need:

- a scanner or camera to create electronic copies of your documents, and
- a valid [credit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/extend/apply.html#centred-popup1) or [debit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/extend/apply.html#centred-popup2) card.

If you can’t apply online

**Step 2: Read the instruction guide**

Even if you apply online, you should [read the instruction guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-5553-applying-change-conditions-extend-your-stay-canada-worker.html) **before** you complete your application. The guide will explain how to complete each field on the form.

**Venezuelan passport holders**

You may need to [complete extra steps when you fill out your application](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/extend/apply.html#tr-venezuela-popup).

**Step 3: Prepare your answers for the online tool**

Before you can upload your forms, you must answer some questions. We use your answers to create a personalized document checklist for you.

**Step 4: Know the fees you have to pay**

In most cases, your fees will include processing fees for you and anyone you include on your application

We’ll ask you to pay your fees at the end of your application.

**Fees for open work permits**

If you’re applying for an open work permit, make sure you pay both fees:

- work permit fee ($155)
- open work permit holder fee ($100)

**Step 5: Create your online account or sign in**

You need an account to apply online. You can use your account to:

- pay your fees
- submit your application
- check your status

**After you apply**

**If you applied online to extend or change your work permit**

After you apply online, we’ll send you a letter in your account (WP-EXT except PGWP) that you can use as proof that you’re authorized to keep working, [if you’re eligible](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/extend/after-apply.html#centred-popup1).

- You can print this letter or show it with your current work permit.
- The letter is proof that you’re authorized to keep working under the **same conditions as your original work permit** until we process your application.
  - You can keep working past the **expiry date on the letter** until we process your application if the conditions are the same as on your original work permit.

**Why there’s an expiry date on the letter**

Your letter automatically lists an expiry date that’s 180 days from the date we receive your application. The letter expires in 180 days because

- it’s the service standard to process this type of application
- many employers and health insurance providers will ask for proof that you’re allowed to work
  - an expiry date helps satisfy their concerns about your status and authorization to work in Canada

**If we don’t finalize your application by the date on your letter**

If we don’t finalize your application by the date on your letter, **you can still keep working until we make a decision**.

If your employer or others need proof that you can continue to work

- you can show them this web page, or
- if your employer is not satisfied with the information on this page, you can [contact us](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc/client-support-centre.html)

**If you applied on paper to extend or change your work permit**

If you applied on paper, you won’t get a letter (WP-EXT except PGWP) that proves you’re authorized to work. This is because we need to make sure that your application is complete and that you meet the requirements to work.

If you applied to extend or change your work permit before it expired, you’re authorized to continue working under the **same conditions as your current work permit**.

You can show your employer proof that you submitted your application. Valid forms of proof include

- a copy of your work permit application
- proof that you paid your fees
- a copy of postal or courier tracking information

**What happens if we approve your application**

You’ll get

- an extension of your current work permit, or
- a work permit with new conditions on it, including
  - the type of work you can do
  - the employer you can work for
  - where you can work

**What to do if your permit expires**

**If your permit expires after you apply**

If you apply to extend or change the conditions of your work permit before it expires, you can legally [stay in Canada](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=188&top=17) until a decision is made on your application.

**If you applied to extend your work permit**

**If you applied for another work permit**

**If you applied for a study permit or visitor record**

**If your permit expires before you apply**

**You must stop working** if you’re still in Canada and either

- your permit expired before you applied
  - for a new work permit
  - for a study permit
  - to stay in Canada as a visitor, or
- you didn’t respect the conditions of your permit

However, you may be able to [apply to restore your status as a worker](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/restore.html).

**What to do if you want to travel outside Canada and then re-enter**

A work permit isn’t a travel document. It doesn’t give you the right to travel to Canada. Along with your permit, you need a valid passport and either

- a [visitor visa,](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/extend/travel-outside-canada.html#visa) **or**
- an [electronic travel authorization (eTA)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/extend/travel-outside-canada.html#eta)

Having an eTA or a visa, along with your work permit, doesn’t guarantee that you can re-enter Canada. You must show the [border services officer](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#border_services_officer) that you meet all the [requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eligibility.html) before you can re-enter.

**If you’re from a visa-exempt country**

Along with your work permit, you need:

- a valid passport and
- an [eTA](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eta.html) (if you plan to travel to Canada by air)

You don’t need an eTA if you’re arriving by car, bus, train or boat (including cruise ship).

Note: When we approved your initial work permit, we automatically issued an eTA to you. See your letter of introduction for details.

**Renewing your work permit**

If we issue your renewed work permit **on or after May 1, 2017**, we will automatically issue you an eTA as well.

If we issued your renewed work permit **before May 1, 2017** and you don’t already have an eTA, you will need to get one before you return to Canada by air.

**If you’re a lawful permanent resident of the United States**

As of April 26, 2022, lawful permanent residents of the United States must show these documents for all methods of travel to Canada:

- a valid passport from their country of nationality (or an equivalent acceptable travel document) and
- a valid green card (or equivalent valid proof of status in the United States)

Complete list of acceptable status documents for lawful permanent residents of the U.S.

**If you’re from a visa-required country**

You’ll need a valid visa and a valid work permit to return to Canada to work. You don’t need a valid visa if you return directly from a visit only to the United States or St. Pierre and Miquelon. You must [re-apply for a visitor visa](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/apply-new-temporary-resident-visa-within-canada.html) if your visa:

- has expired or
- was only valid for a single entry to Canada

Eligible citizens of [some visa-required countries](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eta/eligibility/eta-x.html) will receive an eTA when they renew their work permit. The eTA is electronically linked to the passport you used to renew your permit and is valid for five years or until your passport expires. You can only use the eTA when you **fly to**, or transit through, Canada **by air**. You will receive a letter from us with information about your eTA number and expiration date.

If you already have a valid visitor visa, you can use it to travel to Canada until it expires. A visitor visa will let you travel to Canada by plane, car, bus, train or boat.

**U.S. citizens**

United States citizens should carry:

- a valid U.S. passport when flying to or transiting through a Canadian airport and
- the [right travel documents](http://www.cbsa.gc.ca/travel-voyage/td-dv-eng.html) when driving or arriving in Canada by train, bus or boat

- you need to travel outside Canada before you get your new permit because of an emergency

Restore your status and get a work permit

The expiry date on your work permit is the date you must stop working in Canada. In most cases, it’s also the date your temporary resident status expires in Canada.

If there’s a “Must leave Canada by” date on your work permit

Your status in Canada expires on the “Must leave Canada by” date. This applies even if it’s different than the expiry date on your work permit.

You’ll lose your status if

it expires before you apply to extend or change it

you don’t respect the conditions on your work permit

**If you lose your status**

**You must stop working**.

If you want to stay in Canada and start working again, you must apply to restore your status and get a new work permit.

**If your family members also lost their status**

**If you want to change your permit and restore your status**

If your permit and status have expired, you must restore your initial permit and status first. After that, you can apply for a different permit.

- met the requirements for your stay (for example, you didn’t work illegally)
- [met all the conditions](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=169&top=17) listed on your expired permit before it expired

If it’s been more than 90 days since you lost your status

We’re prioritizing applications for [people who **perform or support essential services**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/agricultural-workers-work-temporarily.html#eligible-nocs).

**When you fill out the work permit application form**

**Working for different employers**

You may be asked to work on more than one farm while you’re in Canada. You **don’t** need a new work permit for each employer.

**Note**: You can’t be asked to work for a different employer without your consent.

**Other agricultural workers**

Your work permit will be [employer-specific](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#employer_specific_work_permit). This means that you can work only for the employer named on your work permit.

**Before you apply**

Your employer must get a positive [labour market impact assessment (LMIA)](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/foreign-workers/agricultural.html). An LMIA is a document from Service Canada that allows an employer to hire a foreign worker through the Temporary Foreign Worker Program.

Your employer must give you:

## **Open work permit for vulnerable foreign workers who are victims of abuse**

**What is abuse**

Any behaviour that scares, controls or isolates you could be abuse. Abuse can be physical, sexual, financial or mental.

Examples of abuse that you should report in your application include:

- physical harm
- forcing you to work in a way that’s unsafe or puts your health at risk
- unsafe or unsanitary living conditions in employer-provided housing
- sexual touching that you did not agree to
- making unwanted sexual comments to you
- controlling where you can go
- stealing from you
- stopping you from seeing friends or co-workers
- taking some or all of the money you are paid
- threats, insults and intimidation
- forcing you to commit fraud
- a third party charging you fees for a job or making promises that aren’t real

**Open work permit for vulnerable workers**

If you’re being abused or at risk of being abused in relation to your job in Canada, you may be eligible for an open work permit for vulnerable workers.

An open work permit lets you work for any employer in Canada, except for one that:

- is listed as ineligible on the [list of employers who have failed to comply with the conditions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/employers-non-compliant.html) or
- regularly offers striptease, erotic dance, escort services or erotic massages

This work permit helps protect your rights as a worker in Canada by helping you leave an abusive situation to find a new job. However, it’s a temporary solution and:

- has an expiry date, and
- can’t be renewed

If you’re approved for this work permit, it should give you enough time to find a new employer and [apply for a new work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/apply.html). You must apply for another work permit before this one expires if you want to stay and work in Canada.

**Who can apply**

You can apply if you

- are inside Canada
  - applications made at a port of entry won’t be accepted
- have a valid employer-specific work permit
  - this is a work permit that has your employer’s name on it and isn’t expired (or you applied to extend it before it expired)
- are being abused or at risk of being abused in relation to your job in Canada

**Fees**

There are no fees for this work permit.

**How to apply**

You must apply online.

**Step 1: Make sure you have what you need**

To apply online, you’ll need a scanner or camera to create electronic copies of your documents.

**Step 2: Read the instruction guide**

Even if you apply online, you should [read the instruction guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-5553-applying-change-conditions-extend-your-stay-canada-worker.html) **before** you complete your application. The guide will explain how to complete each field on the form.

**Step 3: Support your application with evidence**

To support your application, you **must** include a letter to describe

- your situation
- the abuse you’re facing or at risk of facing

We encourage you to use the following form to provide your information:

- [Letter of Explanation – Open Work Permit for Vulnerable Workers \[IMM 0017\] (PDF, 1.8 MB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/kits/forms/imm0017e.pdf)

**Types of evidence**

You should also include as much evidence as you can with your application.  
Evidence could include:

- a letter, statement or report from an abuse support organization, medical doctor, health care professional, etc.
- a sworn statement, also known as an [affidavit](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#affidavit), from yourself
- a copy of an official report you submitted to an enforcement agency, such as a police or Canada Border Services Agency report
- a copy of an official complaint submitted to a provincial government enforcement agency, such as an employment standards branch
- a [victim impact statement](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/cj-jp/victims-victimes/sentencing-peine/vis-dv.html)
- email or text messages
- pay stubs or bank statements
- photos showing injuries or working conditions
- witness testimony

The list above includes **examples** of evidence. You may have other types of evidence.

**Where to upload your evidence**

You can upload your letter of explanation and other documents as evidence in the **Client Information** field under **Optional Documents**.

There’s only 1 Client Information field to upload all of your evidence. You have to combine all your evidence in 1 file and upload it together. [Find out how to upload multiple documents into 1 field](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1160).

**If you can’t upload all of your evidence of abuse**

If you can’t upload all of your evidence due to an issue with the online application, you can also use your letter of explanation to briefly tell us about the evidence and why you can’t upload it. You can submit this evidence later if we ask for it.

**Step 4: Create your online account or sign in**

You need an account to apply online. You can use your account to:

- submit your application
- upload documents
- check your application status

**Step 5: Get to the application**

After you sign in to your account, follow these steps to get to the application:

- Under “**Start an application**”, choose “**Apply to come to Canada**”
- Choose “**Visitor visa, study and/or work permit**”
- Answer the questions in the online tool
- For question 1 “**What would you like to do in Canada?**“, choose “**Work**”
- When asked “**What is your current country/territory of residence?**”, choose “**Canada**”
- When asked “**Do you have a written job offer?**”, choose “**No**”
- When asked “**Does this situation apply to you? You have a valid employer-specific work permit and are being abused or there is a risk of being abused in relation to your job in Canada?**”, choose “**Yes**”
- When you get to the page that says “**Your results**”, choose “**Open work permit for vulnerable workers**”

**Fingerprints and photo (biometrics)**

As of December 3, 2019, most people applying from inside Canada must give their fingerprints and photo (biometrics). However, because you may be in a vulnerable situation, we won’t ask you to give your biometrics when you apply. If an officer determines you need to give your biometrics, they’ll ask you to give them after you apply.

When you apply online, you’ll be asked if you’ve given your biometrics for an application in the past.

- If you’ve given them in the past, choose “**Yes**”.
- If you haven’t given them in the past, choose “**No**”.
  - When asked about the fee, choose the option that says you’re exempt from paying the fee.
  - By choosing this option, you won’t be asked to pay the fee later in the application process.

When you’ve answered all the questions, you’ll get your document checklist. It includes the form “Application to Change Conditions, Extend my Stay or Remain in Canada as a Worker (IMM5710)”. This is the work permit form you need to fill out.

**If you can’t apply online**

You can submit a paper application if either:

- you can’t apply online because of a disability
- there’s a problem with the online application
  - In some cases, you may be able to apply online if you follow special instructions.

[What to do if you have problems applying online](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/problems-applying-online-in-canada-work-study-visit.html)

**After you apply**

After we receive your application at the local office, we’ll contact you within 5 business days to tell you what to do next.

We may ask you to do an interview.

**After you get your open work permit**, we may contact your employer to perform an inspection. We won’t contact them for any other reason.

**Inspections**

We inspect employers to make sure they follow the rules when hiring temporary workers through the [International Mobility Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/hire-temporary-foreign/international-mobility-program/inspections.html) or the [Temporary Foreign Worker Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/foreign-workers/employer-compliance.html). Inspections are meant to protect temporary workers.

If you’re approved for the open work permit for vulnerable workers, we may ask you to give us information to help us inspect your former employer. You don’t have to give us information. The choice is yours.

The inspection can happen at any time after you get your open work permit.

**Open work permit for your family members**

Family members who came with you to Canada may also be eligible for an open work permit if your application is approved. They must complete their own application but may submit it together with your application.

## **H-1B visa holder work permit**

**If you’re not sure if you have the right document**

Ask yourself if this document

- explains what kind of organization you’ll work for
- shows you can do this job
- satisfies an officer that you would be a good camp counsellor

**Step 6: Pay your fees and submit your application**

In most cases, you must pay the work permit processing fee.

You may be exempt from paying the work permit processing fee if

- you’re working for a charitable or religious organization **and**
- you won’t be paid, other than **one** of the following:
  - small payments for living expenses
  - non-monetary benefits (such as room and board, health care insurance)

**Fee exemption**

If you’re exempt from paying the work permit processing fee, your employer will also be exempt from paying the employer compliance fee ($230).

They still need to [submit an offer of employment in the Employer Portal](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/partners-service-providers/employer-portal.html).

If your employer does not show how you meet the fee exemption, you and your employer must pay all fees.

## **Prepare to work in Canada**

How to get your credentials assessed, improve your English and French and get help finding a job.

**Get your credentials assessed in Canada**

You’ll need to have your credentials assessed if you:

- immigrate to Canada as a Federal Skilled Worker
- come to Canada to work in a certain profession or trade
- come to Canada to study

Credentials you got outside Canada will need to be assessed, such as:

- education
- work experience
- professional credentials

Having your credentials assessed will help you:

- show employers what you are qualified for
- understand the types of jobs for you might be qualified for
- see if your credentials are equal to the standards set for Canadian workers
- find out if you need more training, education or Canadian work experience

You can start the process to get your credentials assessed and recognized before you arrive in Canada. This takes time and costs money.

**To immigrate as a Federal Skilled Worker (FSW)**

To apply to the [Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/federal-skilled-workers.html), you must get Educational Credential Assessments (ECAs). This includes any of your completed foreign educational credentials, such as a:

- diploma
- certificate
- foreign degree
- other proof of your credential

We use ECAs to see if your credentials are valid and equal to a completed credential in Canada.

You’ll also need to have your skills and training assessed to work in certain jobs in Canada.

**To work in some jobs in Canada, including certain trades**

No matter which type of job you’re looking for, make sure you have the language skills needed. Even if you have the language skills you need to immigrate to Canada, those skills may not be strong enough to work in the job you want to have.

[Find out more about improving your English or French](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/new-life-canada/improve-english-french.html).

There are two types of jobs in Canada:

- regulated
- non-regulated

**Regulated jobs, including trades**

Regulated jobs are controlled by provincial, territorial, and sometimes federal laws. They are governed by a regulatory body or apprenticeship authority.

Regulated jobs are also called:

- professions
- skilled trades
- apprenticeable trades

They include jobs such as:

- architects
- plumbers
- engineers

These jobs are regulated to:

- protect public health and safety
- make sure people working in these jobs are qualified

About 20 per cent of jobs in Canada are regulated.

In Canada, some provinces and territories regulate some jobs and trades while others do not. If you have a licence to work in a province or territory, it may not be accepted in others.

**Regulatory bodies**

A regulatory body usually assesses credential recognition. Check with the regulatory body or other group for your job to find out if you need to be assessed. They can tell you which [credential assessment agency](http://www.cicic.ca/415/credential-assessment-services.canada) you should use.

You can find out how to contact your regulatory body on [Job Bank](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/findajob/newcomers). You can also check their website to find out more about:

- fees
- licensing
- eligibility
- the process to get your credentials recognized

**Working in a regulated job in Canada**

To work in a regulated job and use a regulated title, **you must**:

- have a licence **or** certificate **or**
- be registered with the regulatory body for your job in the province or territory where you want to work

Each regulated job has its own requirements for getting a licence or certificate. Requirements for entry **can be different between provinces and territories**, but they usually include:

- having your training and skills assessed against the job’s standards
  - this is done by comparing your training with the training provided by Canadian colleges and universities
  - you’ll need to show your original academic transcripts and other related documents, such as university course descriptions
- having your language and communication skills tested
- written exams, an interview or both
- a specified period of supervised work experience

You’ll be evaluated on your own merits. Don’t compare your experience to someone else’s. Understand the requirements as they apply to your own case in the province or territory where you plan to work.

**Trades**

If you want to work in a trade, visit [Red Seal](http://www.red-seal.ca/w.2lc.4m.2@-eng.jsp) for more details about the training, skills and experience you’ll need to meet.

Trades include jobs such as:

- bakers
- carpenters
- electricians

As a tradesperson, you may be eligible to immigrate through the [Federal Skilled Trades Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry.html).

**Non-regulated occupations**

Some employers need job applicants to be registered or certified by the relevant professional association. Having your credentials assessed and recognized helps Canadian employers understand what you’re qualified for.

Job requirements can vary greatly between employers. Be prepared to prove that you have the education or experience to do the job. You may have to:

- show a certain level of skill and competence
- have a certain amount of education
- have personal traits that suit the job

A [credential assessment agency](http://www.cicic.ca/415/credential-assessment-services.canada) can assess your educational credentials for a fee. You may include this information in your résumé or curriculum vitæ (CV).

[Find out more about how to get your credentials assessed to work in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/prepare-life-canada/prepare-work/credential-assessment/process.html)

**To study**

If you plan to study in Canada, you’ll need to have your educational credentials assessed.

Some post-secondary schools can do the assessment. In other cases you’ll need to go to an [assessment agency](http://www.cicic.ca/415/credential-assessment-services.canada).

Contact the post-secondary school you want to go to in Canada to find out what kind of assessment they need and accept. Then, contact the assessment agency recommended by the school you want to attend, if needed.

Assessment agencies:

- charge a fee for their services
- **don’t guarantee** they will recognize your qualifications for:
  - getting accepted to study again in a Canadian post-secondary school
  - employment or certification/licensing purposes in Canada
- make assessments that explain your academic background to:
  - employers
  - post-secondary institutions
  - professional bodies
- compare your academic credentials with similar ones in Canada’s post-secondary educational system

There are separate processes for having your educational credentials recognized for:

- immigrating to Canada as a Federal Skilled Worker
- qualifying to work in a certain job (including getting a license)
- finding a job

When you are talking about immigration in Canada, these words have certain meanings:

**Credentials** refer to

- degrees, diplomas, and certificates that you earned as part of your formal education
- any document that states you are qualified to work in a certain job, such as
  - licence
  - certificate
  - registration

**Qualifications** refers to your combined

- credentials
- knowledge
- skills and
- work experience

These will show if you are **qualified** to perform a certain job.

**Competencies** refer to things that you have learned. They include

- a skill or set of skills
- level of knowledge
- conduct and practice
- ethical, legal, communication behavioural norms for a specific occupation.

**Improving your English and French**

Canada has two official languages: English and French. English is the most commonly spoken language in most provinces and territories.

French is the main language spoken in Quebec and in some areas of Ontario, New Brunswick and Manitoba. There are also francophone communities in all provinces and territories across Canada. Quebec has a large minority of residents who speak English.

We offer all official federal government services, publications and documents in both English and French.

**The importance of language skills**

English or French language skills are very important to help you settle in Canada. You may choose to focus on learning or improving one or the other. This will likely depend on which of the two languages most people speak in the area where you live.

Strong English or French skills will help with:

- getting a job
- going to school
- accessing services
- helping your children with school work
- meeting and talking to people
- getting your Canadian citizenship

Take steps to improve your French or English while you are still in your home country and as soon as you arrive in Canada.

If you already speak an official language, think about learning the other. In many parts of Canada, being able to speak both is an advantage for finding a job and taking part in your community.

The [Language Portal of Canada](http://www.noslangues-ourlanguages.gc.ca/index-eng.php) has a variety of tools and resources to improve your language skills.

**Language skills for work**

The English or French skills you needed to be eligible to immigrate may not be strong enough for you to work in your field.

Most regulated jobs and trades require you to:

- be fluent in English or French
- have a strong knowledge of all work-related language
- understand phrases or expressions used, some of which may be unique to Canada

Find out about the language requirements you must meet to work in your field. If needed, contact your regulatory body to learn about the type of language test that will be used to evaluate or assess you.

You may want to consider taking language classes or looking for bridging programs that offer both language training and work experience.

**Language classes**

You can take language classes to learn English or French once in Canada. Federal, provincial and territorial governments across Canada fund language classes. You’ll need to pay for private language classes.

To find information about other language training programs funded by the provinces or territories:

- [ask an organization that helps newcomers in your area](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/newcomers/services/index.asp)
- [visit the website for newcomers of the province or territory where you live](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/prepare-life-canada/provinces-territories.html)

**Testing your current language skills before you registering**

Before you start a class, you must get tested to find out your current language skills. Visit a [language assessment centre](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/newcomers/services/index.asp) in your city and tell them you’re interested in taking language classes.

You can do a [self-assessment test](http://www.clb-osa.ca/) to find out your current language level before doing a formal language test.

**Language tests and certificates**

There are cases where you may need to prove your ability in either English or French, such as:

- when you apply for a job
- to get into a university or college

There are several language tests that are widely accepted. They will give you a certificate and test results that you can use for many purposes.

English language tests and certificates:

- [International English Language Testing System (IELTS)](http://www.ielts.org/)
- [Canadian English Language Proficiency Index Program (CELPIP)](http://www.celpip.ca/)
- [Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)](http://www.ets.org/toefl) (universities and colleges usually need this)

French language tests and certificates:

- [Test d’évaluation de français (TEF)](https://www.lefrancaisdesaffaires.fr/en/tests-diplomas/test-for-evaluating-french-tef/)
- [Diplôme d’études en langue française (DELF)](http://www.ciep.fr/delfdalf)

You can also find out about these tests from some government language testing centres or private language schools.

**Apply for jobs**

Once you find a job you’re interested in, you’ll usually need to apply by sending your:

- [cover letter](http://www.youth.gc.ca/eng/topics/jobs/cover.shtml), which is a short description of what makes you right for the job
- [résumé](http://www.youth.gc.ca/eng/topics/jobs/resume.shtml), which is:
  - also known as a “curriculum vitae” or a C.V.
  - a list of your qualifications and work experience

The resources listed in the section [Get important information about working in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/prepare-life-canada/prepare-work/look-jobs.html#sec01) can help you:

- find information on writing a résumé and cover letter
- prepare for an interview

**After you apply**

Based on your résumé and cover letter, the employer will decide whether to invite you for a [job interview](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/findajob/resources/prepare-for-interview). A job interview:

- gives the employer a chance to:
  - meet you
  - ask questions to see if you’re right for the job
- helps you to:
  - learn more about the job
  - decide if you want to work for that organization

It’s common for people to send many résumés and cover letters to different places before being invited for a job interview.

You will get a formal job offer if the employer wants to hire you.

**Network**

It is easier to find a job if you have a set network of contacts. Networking can help you search for jobs in Canada’s [hidden job market](http://www.youth.gc.ca/eng/topics/jobs/looking.shtml). It’s also a good way to tell many people that you’re looking for work.

**Work as a volunteer to build your resume**

- get Canadian work experience
- practice your English or French

To find out about programs in your area, contact:

- the professional association or regulatory body for your profession
- a local [immigrant-serving organization](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/newcomers/services/index.asp)

**Consider alternative jobs**

Knowing more about jobs related to your profession can give you more options for working in Canada.

Consider working in an alternative job. This way you can continue to learn about your profession or industry in Canada while you get your licence to work in a regulated occupation or trade.

**Apply to the Federal Internship for Newcomers Program**

The Federal Internship for Newcomers (FIN) Program provides eligible permanent residents and new Canadians with valuable temporary Canadian work experience and training.

**Employment Insurance and other financial support**

**Employment Insurance**

If you’re unemployed, you may be able to get [Employment Insurance (EI)](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei.html). EI gives you short-term financial help while you look for work or upgrade your skills.

You may also get EI benefits if you’re:

- sick, injured or in quarantine for health reasons
- pregnant or caring for a newborn or adopted child
- caring for a family member who is seriously ill with a high risk of death

If you work in Canada, you must pay into EI so that you can use it in a time of need. Your employer will usually take the EI payments from your paycheque.

If you’re self-employed, you can choose to take part in the EI program. To benefit from EI, you must apply and meet certain criteria.

**Financial support for families**

The [Canada child benefit](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/bnfts/ccb/menu-eng.html) (CCB) is a **tax-free** monthly payment made to eligible families to help them with the cost of raising children under 18 years of age. The CCB might include the [child disability benefit](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/bnfts/dsblty-eng.html) and any related [provincial and territorial programs](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/bnfts/rltd_prgrms/menu-eng.html).

**Other financial support programs**

The government has other financial support programs for people in need. In most cases, you must meet certain criteria to use these programs. Use the [Benefits Finder](http://www.canadabenefits.gc.ca/f.1.2ch.4me@.jsp) to find out more.

**Child care**

If you’re working and have young children, you may need to arrange child care. In Canada, most families don’t leave children under the age of 12 at home alone.

There are different options for child care:

- nursery schools
- drop-in day-care centres
- licensed day-care centres
- home-based day-care services

To learn about the options near you, speak to someone at an [immigrant-serving organization](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/newcomers/services/index.asp).

**Pension programs**

There are pension programs that you may be able to use now or in the future:

  - a program for workers and their families
  - a provider of basic financial protection if you lose income because of:
    - retirement
    - disability
    - death
  - paid into by anyone who works in Canada
  - replaced by the [Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)](http://www.rrq.gouv.qc.ca/en/planification/sources_revenu_retraite/Pages/regime_rentes_quebec.aspx) in the province of Quebec
- The [Old Age Security (OAS)](http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/services/pensions/oas/index.shtml) pension is a monthly payment that most people aged 65 or older can get
- The [Guaranteed Income Supplement](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/old-age-security/guaranteed-income-supplement.html) (GIS) is a monthly benefit paid to eligible seniors living in Canada who:
  - receive OAS
  - have little or no other income

**International benefits**

Due to Canada’s [international social security agreements](http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/services/pensions/international/index.shtml), people who’ve lived or worked in another country may be able to get:

- social security benefits from that country **or**
- OAS and CPP benefits in Canada

Social Insurance Number

Overview

SIN data breach

If you have been victim of a data breach, find out how to protect your SIN.

To work in Canada or access government programs and benefits, you need a 9-digit number known as a Social Insurance Number (SIN).

Your SIN is private and it is illegal for anyone else to use it. You are responsible for protecting your SIN.

Service Canada is responsible for issuing SINs, which comes in a paper format (Confirmation of SIN letter). If you have a plastic SIN card that has not expired, it is still valid.

If you have forgotten your SIN

If you cannot remember your SIN, you may:

find it on your income tax return, tax slips, record of employment, RRSP contribution

view it by signing in or registering for My Service Canada Account (MSCA)

obtain a confirmation of your SIN by submitting an application

If you have lost your SIN, or if it was stolen

If you have lost your SIN, or if it was stolen, Service Canada will not issue a new one.

Service Canada may issue a new SIN only if there is proof that the SIN was used fraudulently. If you think this may apply to you, refer to Protecting your SIN for more information.

If you find someone else’s SIN

Please return it to a Service Canada Center or mail it to Service Canada.

Registering a newborn

If your newborn is under one year of age and you have not registered your child’s birth with your province, you can apply for your child’s SIN through your provincial Newborn Registration Service.

This service is available in all Canadian provinces, but is not yet available in the territories.

If you live in the territories, apply for your child’s SIN directly through Service Canada.
