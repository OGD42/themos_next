## **Agri-Food Pilot**

**Status: Accepting applications until May 14, 2025**

The Agri-Food Pilot helps address the labour needs of the Canadian agri-food sector.

The pilot provides a pathway to permanent residence for experienced, non-seasonal workers in specific industries and with specific occupations.

**We’ve made changes to the pilot**

We’ve introduced the following changes as of February 10, 2024:

- applicants who reside in Canada when they submit their application may now choose to meet **either** the job offer requirement or the educational requirement
- we now count work experience gained under an open work permit for vulnerable foreign workers towards the work experience requirement

**Who can apply**

To be eligible, you must

- have an eligible [job offer](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/agri-food-pilot/pr-eligibility.html#offer)  
   • **If you reside in Canada when you submit your application**, you may choose to meet this requirement or the educational requirement.
- meet or pass the [educational requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/agri-food-pilot/pr-eligibility.html#education)

- have maintained your temporary resident status (if already in Canada)

**Job offer**

**If you reside in Canada when you apply**, you may choose to meet **either** the job offer requirement or the educational requirement.

**If you reside outside of Canada when you apply**, you must meet both the job offer **and** the educational requirement.

The job you’re offered must be a [genuine job offer](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/agri-food-pilot/pr-eligibility.html#genuine_modal) and meet **all** of the following requirements:

- The job must be
  - in an [eligible occupation listed under 1 of the eligible industries](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/agri-food-pilot/eligible-industries.html)
  - [full time](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#full_time_work) — This means you work at least 30 paid hours per week.
  - [non-seasonal](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#non_seasonal_work) — This means you have consistent and regularly scheduled paid employment throughout the year.
  - Permanent — This means there is no set end date.
  - in Canada, outside of Quebec
- For unionized positions, the wage must be determined by the applicable collective agreement.
- For non-unionized positions, the wage must meet or exceed the [Job Bank’s prevailing (median) wage](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/trend-analysis/search-wages) for the occupation listed on your job offer in the province of employment (or at the national level if no provincial rate is available).

**Educational requirements**

**If you are residing in Canada when you apply**, you may choose to meet **either** the educational requirement or the job offer requirement.

**If you are residing outside of Canada when you apply**, you must meet **both** the educational requirement **and** the job offer.

You must have at least

- a Canadian high school diploma **or**
- an educational credential assessment (ECA) report from a designated organization or professional body showing that you completed a foreign credential at the secondary school level or above
  - The ECA report must be less than 5 years old on the date of your application.
  - The original ECA report must have been issued on or after the date the organization was designated.

**How to get an educational credential assessment**

**Work experience**

Your Canadian work experience must be

- at least 1 year of cumulative, [non-seasonal](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#non_seasonal_work), [full-time](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#full_time_work) work in the past 3 years (at least 1,560 hours)

- gained though
  - an open work permit for vulnerable workers or
  - a work permit issued on the basis of a labour market impact assessment (LMIA) with a minimum 12-month duration, under the Temporary Foreign Worker Program

If you’re not sure of the duration of the LMIA that was submitted by your employer when hiring you, you can ask the employer.

You must give us the following as proof of your work experience:

- an employer or union reference letter (only for unionized positions)
- a letter of employment
- a T4
- paystubs

**Open work permits**

If you currently have an open work permit, but you **used to have** a work permit through the Temporary Foreign Worker Program, you may have eligible work experience.

However, any work experience you gained while holding an open work permit **does not count** unless it was gained under an open work permit specifically for vulnerable workers.

**How to calculate your hours of work experience**

- **Do** count the hours worked in [full-time jobs](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#full_time_work)
  - The hours can be in different eligible occupations and with different employers.
  - The hours must have been worked over a total period of at least 12 months (Note: working more than 30 hours per week does not shorten this period).
- **Don’t** count
  - hours you weren’t paid for (volunteering or unpaid internships)
  - hours worked when you were self-employed
  - hours worked in part-time or seasonal positions
  - hours where your work was not authorized by IRCC

**Language requirements**

You must prove your ability in English or French.

The minimum language requirements are **Canadian Language Benchmarks (CLB)** or **Niveaux de compétence linguistique canadiens (NCLC) Level 4** in :

- **reading**
- **writing**
- **speaking**
- **listening**

You must submit your results from an approved language test.

Your test results must be less than 2 years old when you apply. We count the 2 years from the date you took the test.

[Find out more about language testing](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/agri-food-pilot/language-testing.html)

**Settlement funds**

You must prove that you have enough money to settle in Canada. You’ll need to prove that you have enough funds to support yourself and any family members you may have, even if they’re not coming to Canada with you.

If you’re already working in Canada with a valid work permit when you apply, you don’t need to provide proof of settlement funds.

**Language testing**

**How to prove your language ability**

To prove your language skills in English or French, you need to take an approved language test. To do this:

- schedule your test with an approved agency
- pay the test costs
