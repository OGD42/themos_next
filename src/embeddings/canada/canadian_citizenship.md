After you take the test, you’ll get your test result. Your next steps will depend on whether you pass or don’t pass the test.

#### Test result

How you get the test result depends on whether you took the test online, on Microsoft Teams or in person:
**Online test**
You’ll get the **unofficial** test score right after you submit the test.

After you submit the test, we **need time** to further review it before the test result becomes **official**.

Test on Microsoft Teams or in person

You’ll get your official test score right after you take the test.

#### If you pass the test

You pass the test if you correctly answer at least 15 out of 20 questions (75%).

After you pass the test, we

- may invite you to an interview with a citizenship official (case-by-case)
- will invite you to the [citizenship ceremony](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/citizenship-ceremony.html)

#### If you fail the test

You have up to 3 chances to pass the test (whether [online](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/citizenship-test.html#online) or on [Microsoft Teams or in person](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/citizenship-test.html#in-person)).

If you fail the test 3 times, we’ll invite you to a [hearing with a citizenship official](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=366&top=). At the hearing, we’ll orally ask you questions that are similar to those on the citizenship test.

If you pass the hearing, we’ll continue processing your application.

If you fail the hearing

- we’ll refuse your application
- you need to reapply and pay the fees again if you still want to become a citizen

If you don’t pass the test **and** applied as a family or a group

When you apply as a family or a group, we process all applications together. If you have to do a retest or go to a hearing, we may invite your co-applicants to the citizenship ceremony before you.

If you want everyone to attend the same ceremony, ask us to pause processing of the applications. We’ll wait until you pass the test or hearing so everyone can be a citizen at the same time.

#### Prepare for the citizenship ceremony

We’ll invite most applicants to a [video oath ceremony (virtual citizenship ceremony)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/citizenship-ceremony/video.html).

Some applicants may be invited to an in-person ceremony.

We’re working on updating the information on this page. For more information, [wait for and check your invitation](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/citizenship-ceremony.html#check_your_invitation).

Taking the Oath of Citizenship at a citizenship ceremony is your final step to become a Canadian citizen. Citizenship ceremonies take place across the country and at all times of the year. There are special ceremonies on [Canada Day](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/take-part-citizenship/canada-day.html) and during Citizenship Week.

#### Who has to take the oath

Adults and children aged 14 or over must go to the citizenship ceremony and take the oath.

Parents will get certificates of citizenship for their children under age 14. Children under age 14 don’t have to go, but are welcome to.

Get an oath accommodation or waiver (exemption)

You may be in a situation where you need

- help with the oath (accommodation) or
- an exemption from taking it (waiver)

#### Accommodation

If you need help with the oath of citizenship, you can request an accommodation. For example, you can get sign language interpretation when you take the oath.

[Learn more about accommodations](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/apply/accommodation.html)

#### Waiver (exemption)

We’ll give a waiver **only** if a mental disability (like an intellectual or a developmental disability) prevents someone from understanding the oath.

- For example, they don’t understand that taking the oath makes them a Canadian citizen.
- If we **approve** the waiver request, the applicant doesn’t need to take the oath of citizenship.

[Learn more about waivers](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/eligibility/waiver.htm)

#### Get your citizenship ceremony date

We’ll invite you to the citizenship ceremony by email or mail 1 to 2 weeks in advance.

The invitation will have the ceremony’s

- time and date

#### Check your junk folder for our emails

- If you gave us your email address in your application, we’ll contact you by email.
- To avoid missing our emails, **check your junk or spam folder**.
- Look for messages from email addresses ending in “@cic.gc.ca.”

#### Wait time for the ceremony invitation

Every application is different. The wait time for your ceremony invitation depends on

- our [current processing time (updated weekly)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html)
- your situation
  - For example, if you’re between 18 and 54 years old when you sign your application, you must [pass the citizenship test](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/citizenship-ceremony.html#citizenship-test-lbx).
  - You may wait longer if your application is [non-routine](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1169&top=5).

#### Check your application status

You can find the latest status information for your ceremony invitation by [checking your application status](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-status.html).

If the “Citizenship ceremony” section of the citizenship status tracker has an “In progress” status, it means we

- are in the process of scheduling your ceremony
- will send you the invitation at least 1 week before the ceremony date

If you contact us, we **cannot** give you more information than what’s available in your application status.

If you’re not available on the day of your ceremony, send us a message to explain why and get a new date. If you don’t give an explanation or your explanation isn’t reasonable, we may stop processing your application and not grant you citizenship. You can either:

- email or write to the office that sent you the notice (within 30 days of the appointment) or
- use the online [web form](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/contacts/web-form.asp)

Generally, once we receive your message, we’ll schedule your ceremony on a different day. We’ll let you know by email if you gave us your email address or letter mail if we don’t have your email address.

You need to stay in the room for the entire ceremony. If you’re bringing a young child, also bring a guest who can take them out of the room if they get restless and need to leave the ceremony room. If you can’t arrange child care, let us know and we’ll reschedule your ceremony date.

#### Language of your ceremony

Your notice tells you if your ceremony will be mostly in English, mostly in French, or bilingual. If you want to attend a bilingual ceremony, contact the office that sent you the notice.

#### What to bring

When you come to the ceremony, bring:

- your ceremony notice
- a signed copy of the Permission Release and Consent form (included with the notice)
- [permanent resident card](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card.html) if you have one (even if it’s expired) or Confirmation of Permanent Residence (IMM5292 or IMM5688)
- Record of Landing (IMM 1000) if you became a permanent resident before June 28, 2002
- 2 pieces of personal identification (ID)
  - one piece of ID must have your photograph and signature, for example: driver’s license, health card or permanent resident card
  - foreign ID documents **must be** government-issued, Canadian ones don’t need to be government-issued
  - if they’re not in English or French, you must provide a translation with an [affidavit](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#affidavit) from the translator
  - minors are not required to show identification with a signature
- all your passports and travel documents, current and expired, that you listed on the application form
- optional: a holy book, of your choice, if you want to use one to swear the Oath of Citizenship

#### What happens at the ceremony

During your ceremony, you will:

- take the Oath of Citizenship
- get your [citizenship certificate](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/proof-citizenship/documents.html)
- sign the Oath or Affirmation of Citizenship form
- sing the national anthem, O Canada

A citizenship judge or official will preside over the ceremony and lead the Oath of Citizenship. Many people will take the oath with you. The ceremony official will say the oath in English and in French. As a group, you’ll repeat the words to the oath after the official. You must repeat the oath in at least one of the official languages, but we encourage you to say them in both. You’ll also be invited to sing the bilingual version of the national anthem.

You can swear or affirm the oath. Swearing is for people who want to refer to their religious beliefs and affirming is for people who don’t want to refer to religious text. If you want to swear the oath on your holy book, bring it with you.

Once you take the Oath of Citizenship, you’ll be a Canadian citizen. We’ll give you your citizenship certificate as proof that you’re a Canadian citizen. It will show the date that you became a citizen. Keep it in a safe place.

#### Prepare to say the oath and sing the anthem

We’ll give you the words to the oath and the anthem at the ceremony, but you can practice to prepare for the ceremony.

#### After the citizenship ceremony

**Get your citizenship certificate**

## **Changes to citizenship rules and requirements**

The [Citizenship Act](laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-29/) defines

- who is Canadian
- what you need to become a Canadian

We’ve made changes to

- what you need to apply for citizenship
- the rules about who is or isn’t a Canadian citizen

Changes to rules on citizenship by descent

Before July 2020, only biological parents could pass down their Canadian citizenship to their children.

As of July 2020, non-biological parents can pass down their Canadian citizenship to their children who were born outside Canada if they’re the child’s legal parent at birth (opens in a new tab).

There are some exceptions for both parents.

How to pass your Canadian citizenship down to your child

You can pass down your Canadian citizenship to your child by applying for a citizenship certificate.

You need to submit a copy of your child’s original birth certificate or record with your application.

If needed, we’ll ask for supporting documents to make sure that you can pass down your citizenship to your child.

Adopted children born outside Canada

If your adopted child was born outside Canada, they’re not automatically a Canadian citizen. This is to respect the adoption laws of other countries and the Citizenship Act.

You need to apply for your adopted child to become a Canadian citizen.

#### Changes to citizenship requirements 2017 to 2018

[Citizenship requirement changes 2017 (PDF, 294.58KB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/citizenship-requirement-changes-2017.pdf)

On October 11, 2017, some changes to the Citizenship Act as a result of Bill C-6 became law. Here are some of the changes you need to know about:

#### Physical presence

You must be physically present in Canada for 3 out of the last 5 years with no minimum number of days per year, before applying for citizenship.

**Previously**: You had to be physically present in Canada for 4 out of 6 years, with a minimum of 183 days in each of the 4 years, before applying for citizenship.

Days spent in Canada before becoming a permanent resident (as a temporary resident or protected person) within 5 years of applying for citizenship, count as ½ days, up to a maximum of 1 year (365 days).

**Previously**: The time spent in Canada before becoming a permanent resident did not count towards the physical presence requirement for citizenship.

#### Language and knowledge

If you are between 18 years old and 54 years old, you must:

- Meet language (English or French) requirements
- Take the Citizenship Test

**Previously**: If you were between 14 and 64 years, you had to meet the language and knowledge requirement for citizenship.

#### Income tax

You have to file Canadian income taxes (if required to do so under the Income Tax Act) for 3 out of 5 years, matching the new physical presence requirement.

**Previously**: You had to file Canadian income taxes, if required to do so under the Income Tax Act, for 4 out of 6 years.

#### All the changes went into effect on October 11, 2017

**Changes to citizenship rules 2009 to 2015**

The Citizenship Act was amended in 2009 and 2015. This changed the citizenship rules about who is or isn’t a Canadian citizen. These changes include:

- recognizing some people as citizens for the first time
- giving Canadian citizenship to certain people who lost it

None of the changes took Canadian citizenship away from anyone who was a Canadian citizen before the rules came into effect.

The changes don’t give citizenship to anyone who [renounced their citizenship](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/renounce-canadian-citizenship.html) with the Canadian government, or who had their citizenship revoked because they got it through fraud.

#### Changes in 2015

In 2015, you became a Canadian citizen if you were:

- born or naturalized in Canada before January 1, 1947, but stopped being a British subject and didn’t become a citizen on that date
  - in Newfoundland and Labrador this date is April 1, 1949
- a British subject usually living in Canada but weren’t eligible for Canadian citizenship on January 1, 1947
  - in Newfoundland and Labrador this date is April 1, 1949
- born outside Canada in the first generation before January 1, 1947, to a parent described above
  - in Newfoundland and Labrador this date is April 1, 1949
- born outside Canada in the first generation before January 1, 1947, to a parent who became a citizen on that date and you didn’t become a citizen on that date
  - in Newfoundland and Labrador this date is April 1, 1949
- foreign-born and adopted before January 1, 1947, and at least one adoptive parent became a Canadian citizen on that date and the [adoptive parent is eligible to pass on citizenship by descent](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/act-changes/rules-2009-2015/adoption.html)
  - in Newfoundland and Labrador this date is April 1, 1949

In 2015, you **didn’t** become a Canadian citizen if you:

- had your British subject status revoked
- renounced your British subject status
- were born outside Canada after the first generation (unless one of the [exceptions to the first generation limit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/act-changes/rules-2009-2015.html#exceptions) to citizenship by descent apply)

#### Changes in 2009

In 2009, you became a Canadian citizen if you:

- lost your Canadian citizenship after you:
  - became a Canadian citizen on January 1, 1947
  - were born or naturalized in Canada on or after January 1, 1947
- were [foreign-born and adopted by Canadian parents on or after January 1, 1947](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/act-changes/rules-2009-2015/adoption.html)
- were born outside Canada in the first generation to a Canadian parent on or after January 1, 1947, and you lost or never had citizenship due to former citizenship provisions

In 2009, you **didn’t** become a Canadian citizen if you:

- didn’t become a citizen on January 1, 1947
- were born in Canada but weren’t a Canadian citizen at birth because:
  - one of your parents was a foreign diploma
  - neither of your parents was a permanent resident or Canadian citizen
- were born outside Canada to a Canadian parent and were:
  - not already a Canadian citizen or you had lost your citizenship in the past
  - born in the second or subsequent generation (this includes people who failed to retain citizenship)

#### Amendments to the Citizenship Act limit citizenship by descent

On April 17, 2009, the rules for Canadian citizenship changed for persons:

- born outside Canada to Canadian parents
- who weren’t already Canadian citizens when the rules changed

These rules didn’t take Canadian citizenship away from anyone who was a Canadian citizen before the rules came into effect.

Canadian citizenship by birth outside Canada to a parent who is a Canadian citizen (citizenship by descent) is now limited to the first generation born outside Canada.

This means that if you weren’t already a Canadian citizen by April 17, 2009, and were born outside Canada to a Canadian parent, you **aren’t** Canadian if your Canadian parent was:

- also born outside Canada to a Canadian parent
  - this would make you the second or subsequent generation born outside Canada
- granted Canadian citizenship under section 5.1, the adoption provisions of the Citizenship Act
  - this would make you the second generation born outside Canada

However, you may be an [exception to the first generation limit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/act-changes/rules-2009-2015.html#exceptions) if your Canadian parent or grandparent was employed in certain situations.

#### Exceptions to the first generation limit

If you were born outside Canada in the second or later generation, the first generation limit to citizenship doesn’t apply to you if:

- at the time of your birth, your Canadian **parent** was employed outside Canada, other than as a locally engaged person (a crown servant):
  - with the Canadian Armed Forces
  - with the federal public administration
  - with the public service of a province or territory
- at the time of your Canadian parent’s birth or adoption, your Canadian **grandparent** was employed outside Canada, other than as a locally engaged person (a crown servant):
  - in the Canadian Armed Forces
  - with the federal public administration
  - with the public service of a province or territory

The rules may also affect children adopted by Canadian parents outside Canada, depending on how your child got, or will get, citizenship.

If you were born to a Canadian parent and aren’t eligible for citizenship by descent due to the first generation limit, you may:

- apply for and get permanent resident status
- submit an application for a grant of citizenship under section 5 of the Citizenship Act

A permanent resident (PR) card proves you’re a permanent resident when you return to Canada from another country. Before you apply, make sure you’re [eligible](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card/who-can-apply.html).

#### If you want to leave Canada

Make sure you have your valid permanent resident (PR) card. You’ll need it to return to Canada by plane, train, bus or boat.

- [Renew your PR card](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card/how-to-apply.html) **before** leaving Canada.
- If you need your application processed urgently, check and see if you qualify.

Even if you qualify for urgent processing, **we can’t guarantee that you’ll get your PR card on time**. We can’t process PR card applications in less than 3 weeks.

#### Return to Canada without a valid permanent resident (PR) card

If you leave, or have already left Canada without a valid PR card, you must [apply for a permanent resident travel document](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-travel-document.html) (PRTD) to re-enter Canada.

It might take longer than normal to process your PRTD application. This could delay your return to Canada.

When traveling to Canada, you need your valid PR card or PRTD when boarding any of the following vehicles:

- plane
- train
- bus
- boat

**If you don’t have your document with you, you may not be allowed to board.**

### Who can apply

#### New permanent residents

New permanent residents **don’t need to apply** for a permanent resident card (PR card). We will send one to you when you immigrate to Canada if you tell us your Canadian mailing address. You have 180 days after immigrating to [send it to us](https://services3.cic.gc.ca/ecas/?app=coanotify&lang=en). If we don’t get it in time, then you have to apply for your card. There is a $50 processing fee for PR card applications.

#### Eligibility

To be eligible for a PR card, you need to:

- be a [permanent resident](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card/understand-pr-status.html), and
- submit your application **in Canada**.

**If [your PR card isn’t ready before you leave Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/permanent-residents.html#leavecanada) or if you’re outside Canada without a valid PR card**, you need to apply for a [permanent resident travel document](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-travel-document.html) (PRTD). After you return to Canada, apply for a PR card.

You should **only** apply for a PR card if:

- your card has expired or will expire in less than 9 months
- your card is lost, stolen, or destroyed
- you didn’t receive your card within 180 days of immigrating to Canada
- you need to update your card to:
  - legally change your name
  - change your citizenship
  - change your gender designation
  - correct your date of birth

Otherwise, we may not process your application.

You **aren’t eligible** for a PR card if you were asked by the Government of Canada to leave the country. If you are a [Canadian citizen](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/eligibility/already-citizen.html), you can’t have (and don’t need) a PR card. If you become a Canadian citizen, give us your PR card at your [citizenship ceremony](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/citizenship-ceremony.html).

#### Time lived in Canada

To keep your permanent resident status, you must have been in Canada for at least **730 days** during the last five years. These 730 days don’t need to be continuous. Some of your time abroad may count towards the 730 days.

To help you track your time in Canada, use a [travel journal](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/eligibility/record-trips-outside-canada.html). Other ways to know how long you’ve been in Canada:

- Ask a Canadian border officer when you enter Canada.
- [Apply for or renew your PR card](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card.html). We will tell you if you’re eligible.

#### Before you apply

A permanent resident card (PR card) is usually issued for five years, but can sometimes be issued for one year instead. It is valid until the expiry date listed on the card.

We only send PR cards to addresses within Canada. In some cases, you may have to pick up your card in person at one of our Canadian offices.

**If you find a mistake on your PR card** you can ask for it to be reissued. Sometimes we shorten a name on the card if it is too long to fit. This is not a mistake. [Find out how to fix a mistake on your PR card](www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=563&top=10).

#### Replace a lost, stolen or destroyed PR card

You need to tell us what happened before you apply.

If you are **outside Canada**, go to the [nearest visa office](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc/offices.html). Then you need to apply for a [permanent resident travel document](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-travel-document.html) (PRTD) to return to Canada. When you are back in Canada, you can continue with your application.

If you are **inside Canada**, tell us what happened using this web form. To complete the form:

- Choose Tell us more then answer No and Proceed to Web form.
- Choose Permanent resident card and Renewal and replacement.

## **Understand permanent resident status**

Permanent residents (PRs) of Canada must carry and present their valid PR card or permanent resident travel document (PRTD) when boarding a flight to Canada, or traveling to Canada on any other commercial carrier. If you do not carry your PR card or PRTD, you may not be able to board your flight, train, bus or boat to Canada.

It is your responsibility to ensure that your PR card is still valid when you return from travel outside Canada, and to apply for a new PR card when your current card expires. If your PR card expires, it does not mean you have lost permanent resident status.

A permanent resident (PR) is someone who has been given PR status by [immigrating to Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada.html), but is not a [Canadian citizen](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship.html). PRs are usually citizens of other countries, while some may be stateless persons.

When refugees [resettle in Canada from overseas](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-outside-canada.html), they become PRs through the [Government-Assisted Refugee Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-outside-canada/private-sponsorship-program.html) or the [Private Sponsorship of Refugees Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-outside-canada/private-sponsorship-program.html).

If you make a refugee claim in Canada, you don’t become a PR immediately. To become one, the Immigration and Refugee Board must first approve your claim. Then, you must apply for and obtain PR status.

You’re **not** a PR if you’re only in Canada for a short time (for example, as a student or foreign worker).

#### The permanent resident (PR) card

Your [PR card](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card.html) proves that you have PR status in Canada. If you travel outside Canada and return on a commercial vehicle (like an airplane, boat, train or bus), you must show

- your PR card **and**
- your passport or refugee travel document

If you’re **traveling outside Canada without a valid PR** card with you, apply for a [permanent resident travel document (PRTD)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-travel-document.html) before returning to Canada by commercial vehicle.

If your **PR card was lost, stolen or damaged**, apply for a [replacement PR card](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card/how-to-apply.html).

#### How to properly dispose of your expired PR card

Destroy your old PR card by cutting it in half before disposing of it so you protect your information and privacy.

#### What permanent residents can do

As a PR, you

- get most social benefits that Canadian citizens receive, including a [social insurance number](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/apply.html) to work in Canada, and health care coverage (check your provincial website for more information)
- can live, work or study anywhere in Canada
- can apply for [Canadian citizenship](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship.html)
- get protection under Canadian law and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
- must pay taxes and respect all Canadian laws at the federal, provincial and municipal levels

#### What permanent residents cannot do

You’re not allowed to

- vote or run for political office or
- hold some jobs that need a high-level security clearance

#### Time lived in Canada

To keep your PR status, you must have been in Canada for at least **730** days during the last five years. These 730 days don’t need to be continuous. Some of your time outside Canada may count towards the 730 days you need.

- [Find out if your time outside Canada counts toward your 730 days](https://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1466&top=10).
- Track your time in Canada with our [travel journal](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/eligibility/record-trips-outside-canada.html).

#### Losing your permanent resident status

You won’t lose your PR status when your PR card expires.

You will only lose your PR status if
an officer determines you are no longer a PR after - an inquiry or PRTD appeal following a refusal

- you voluntarily renounce your PR status
- a removal order made against you comes into force
- you become a Canadian citizen

Even if you don't meet the residency obligation, you will stay a PR until an official decision is made on your status.

[Learn how to avoid travel delays if you are not sure of your status](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card/understand-pr-status/am-i-pr.html).

#### Voluntarily giving up (renouncing) permanent resident status

We won’t change your PR status automatically and we’ll always inform you of the change.

In some cases, you may decide you don’t want to be a PR of Canada anymore. For example, you may want to renounce your PR status in the following situations:

- You have not met your residency obligations by being outside of Canada for a long period of time.
- You plan to visit Canada and want to avoid the processing delays from a formal assessment of your PR status when you arrive.

In these cases, you may not be able to enter Canada until your PR status is resolved either by [applying for a PRTD](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-travel-document.html) or by voluntarily giving up (renouncing) your PR status.

## **Urgent processing of a permanent resident card**

To qualify for urgent permanent resident (PR) card processing, you must be traveling within the next three months due to:

- a job opportunity
- your own serious illness
- the death of a family member
- work related to your current job
- the serious illness of a family member

Even if you qualify for urgent processing, we can’t guarantee that you’ll get your PR card on time. See the current [processing times](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html) for PR cards.

## **Tell us your Canadian address**

You can [tell us your Canadian address](https://services3.cic.gc.ca/ecas/?app=coanotify&lang=en) within 180 days of arriving to get your permanent resident (PR) card delivered to you. You don’t need to do anything else to get your first PR card.

[Change your address](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/change-address.html) instead if you:

- have an **application in progress, and**
- are moving within **three weeks** or have already moved.

## **Record your trips outside Canada**

As a temporary or permanent resident, it’s a good idea to write down your trips outside Canada by air, land or boat, including day trips to the United States. You’ll need this information when you [apply for a new Permanent Residence](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card/apply-renew-replace.html) card and when you [apply for citizenship](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/apply.html).

The travel journal is an easy way to record trips outside Canada. Keep it with your passport or other travel documents. This is not an official document and we don’t need to see it. It’s just to help you remember your trips. You won’t need to send it to us with your application.

#### What to record

- The date you left and the date you came back to Canada, even if it’s the same day
- Countries you visited
- Why you left – give examples like vacation, work, family, etc.
- Include any day trips (less than 24 hours), including to the United States
- When the journal is full, keep it safe and print a new copy

## **Correct a mistake on your PR card**

If the wrong information is on your permanent resident (PR) card, you can fix it by getting your card reissued or by applying for a new one. The method you choose depends on the reason for the error.

**If you are correcting your name**, the name on your PR card must match your foreign passport. There is limited space for your name on a PR card. If we shorten your name, it is not a mistake, and we will not update your PR card. For cards issued before November 21, 2015, names are limited to:

- first name: 15 letters or less
- last name: 20 letters or less

For cards issued on or after November 21, 2015, names are shortened to:

- first name: 28 letters or less
- last name: 28 letters or less

#### Get your card reissued

When we make a mistake or miss something on your permanent resident (PR) card, you can apply for a **reissued** card. However, this only applies when we make the mistake.

[Apply for a reissued PR card](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/request-reissue-permanent-resident-card.html)

#### Apply for a new card

If you need to correct something for another reason, you have to [apply for a **new** PR card](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card/apply-renew-replace.html). Other reasons may include:

- legal name change
- name change after marriage or divorce
- updated signature

## **Prepare for life in Canada**

Get prepared for life in Canada. Find a job, get your credentials assessed, improve your English and French, and find out what to expect when you get to Canada—financially, socially and culturally.

## **Crossing the border: documents you need**

**Prepare your documents with care**

There are documents you **must** have to cross the border into Canada. Without these documents, we won’t allow you into the country.

You may also need many of the other documents listed below. Have your important documents translated into English or French before you arrive to make it easier for people in Canada to understand them.

#### Essential documents

To enter Canada, you’ll need:

- a Canadian immigrant visa (if this applies)
- Confirmation of Permanent Residence for each family member traveling with you
- a valid passport or other travel document for each family member traveling with you
- two copies each of:
  - a detailed list of all the personal or household items you’re bringing with you
  - a list of items that are arriving later and their money value

**Don’t** pack these documents in your luggage. Keep them with you at all times.

#### Settler’s effects list

Before you arrive, you should prepare two copies of a list (preferably typed) of all the goods you plan to bring into Canada as. The list should:

- show each item’s value, make, model and serial number (if it has one)
- be divided into two sections:
  - the goods you’re bringing with you
  - items that are arriving later and their money value

Give this list to the border services officer when you first get to Canada, even if you aren’t bringing in any goods at that time.

You can make the process easier by filling out a [BSF186, Personal Effects Accounting Documents](www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/forms-formulaires/bsf186-eng.html) form before you travel and giving it to the officer when you arrive.

#### Disclosure of funds

Tell a Canadian official when you arrive in Canada if you’re carrying more than CAN $10,000. If you don’t, you may be fined, and your funds could be seized.

These funds could be in the form of:

- cash
- cheques
- bankers’ drafts
- travelers’ cheques or money orders
- securities that belong to you, such as:
  - stocks
  - bonds
  - debentures
  - treasury bills

Find out more about your [duty to disclose funds](www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel-voyage/ttd-vdd-eng.html) either before you leave or once you arrive in Canada.

#### Health documentation

Children in Canada are vaccinated (immunized) starting when they are newborns. Vaccinations help to prevent serious infections or diseases.

When you travel to Canada, bring official documents that state what vaccinations you and your family have already had. If you or your child hasn’t been vaccinated, call your doctor or local public health clinic right away.

In Canada, your children need immunization or vaccination records to enrol in school.

#### Other documents

Other documents you may need include:

- marriage certificates
- driver’s licence, including:
  - an International Driver’s Permit
  - a reference from your auto insurance company
- adoption, separation or divorce papers
- birth certificates or baptismal certificates
- letters of reference from former employers
- trade or professional certificates and licences
- car registration documents (if you’re importing a motor vehicle into Canada)
- school records, diplomas or degrees for each family member traveling with you
- a list of your educational and professional qualifications and job experience for your résumé

Make photocopies of all these types of documents, in case the originals get lost. Be sure to keep the photocopies in a separate place from the originals.

#### Customs declaration card

Before you arrive in Canada, you may be asked to complete a [Customs Declaration Card](www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/forms-formulaires/e311-eng.html). Complete this card before meeting with customs and immigration officials, even if you aren’t a Canadian citizen.

If you’re traveling by air, it’s a good idea to complete the card before you leave the airplane.

#### What to declare

Use the Customs Declaration Card to declare what you’re bringing into Canada, including any:

- items you must pay duty on, such as:
  - gifts
  - alcohol
  - tobacco
- amount of money more than CDN $10,000
- business goods, plants, food, animals, firearms or other weapons

Don’t use this form to list personal and household goods you’re bringing with you or are following you to Canada. You’ll show your lists of those items separately to a customs officer.

#### Declare all items

If you don’t tell an official that you’re carrying items or money that should be declared, you may be fined or put in prison.

For more information, contact the [Canada Border Services Agency](www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html).

## **Bringing goods to Canada**

When you move to Canada from another country, you may bring your personal and household goods with you without paying duty. You’ll have to pay duty on any item you bring that hasn’t been used.

A duty is a fee that the government charges on some goods when they enter Canada.

You don’t have to pay duty on:

- books
- linens
- clothes
- jewellery
- antiques
- furniture
- silverware
- musical instruments
- gifts worth CDN $60 or less each
- hobby tools and other hobby items
- private collections of coins, stamps or art
- appliances, such as a stove or refrigerator

You **do have to pay** duty on:

- farm equipment
- equipment you plan to use in:
  - contracting
  - construction
  - manufacturing
- vehicles you plan to use for business
- items you have bought on your way to Canada
- items you have leased or rented
  - we don’t consider leased or rented items things that you own

If you’re not sure if you have to pay duty on some items, bring sales receipts and registration documents with you.

#### Wedding gifts

You may bring your wedding gifts without paying duty if you:

- get married within three months of coming to Canada
- plan to marry no later than three months after you arrive here

However, you must have owned the gifts before you arrived in Canada. These same conditions apply to household goods you bring in as wedding gifts.

#### Alcohol and tobacco

If you bring alcohol or tobacco, you may have to pay duty on it.

Learn more about [rules regarding these products](travel.gc.ca/returning/customs/what-you-can-bring-home-to-canada#alcohol).

#### Vehicles

Vehicles you bring into Canada for personal use are duty-free. There may be some limits. Cars must meet Canadian safety and pollution control standards.

Learn more about [importing vehicles into Canada](www.tc.gc.ca/eng/roadsafety/safevehicles-importation-index-443.htm).

#### Restricted items

There are different restrictions on bringing firearms into Canada depending on if you’re:

- [a permanent resident](travel.gc.ca/returning/customs/what-you-can-bring-home-to-canada#firearms-weapons)
- [planning to move to Canada](www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/fs-fd/moving-emmenager-eng.htm)

There are also [restrictions on bringing endangered species, animals and plants](travel.gc.ca/returning/customs/what-you-can-bring-home-to-canada#food-plants-animals) into Canada.

#### Jewellery or precious ornaments

Officers may ask you questions about your jewellery or precious ornaments during your customs interview. Make sure you describe these items on your list of goods. To avoid delays at customs when you enter Canada:

- use the wording from your insurance policy or jeweler’s appraisal on your list of goods
- include photographs of the items
- know how much you paid for the items or have a receipt showing how much you paid
  - you don’t need to pay duty or tax on family heirlooms

#### Gifts

You must declare all gifts to the Canada Border Services Agency. You:

- can bring in gifts worth CDN $60 or less each duty-free and tax-free
- may have to pay duties and taxes on any amount over CDN $60
- can’t import tobacco and alcohol as gifts

## **Prepare financially**

Estimate how much it’ll cost you to live in Canada.

**Before you move**

Find out how much it costs to live where you’re planning to settle in Canada. The cost of living will vary depending on where you decide to settle. Some costs will be similar for items and services across Canada.

Learn if your home country has a limit on how much money you can remove by checking with your:

- lawyer
- banker
- financial adviser

Read the [Canada Border Services Agency](www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html) website to find out more about:

- bringing money with you to Canada
- items you can import duty-free and tax-free

#### Proof of funds

You’ll have to prove you have enough money to support yourself and your family after you arrive in Canada if you’re immigrating as a:

- skilled worker (Express Entry)
- self-employed person

You’ll need to provide [proof of your funds](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/proof-funds.html) to the Canadian visa office in your home country when you apply to immigrate.

#### Your cost of living may be different

Your life in Canada will be different than in your home country.

You may have to take a job with lower pay while you upgrade your skills or get experience working here. That means your financial status could change.

Even if you earn a higher salary in Canada than you were earning in your home country, the cost of living in Canada may be higher than you’re used to.

Household expenses can take up to half your take-home pay in Canada. These expenses include the cost of your:

- home
- heating and other utilities
- food
- clothing
- health insurance
- transportation

#### Your home will cost the most

Most Canadians spend 35% to 50% of their income on housing and utilities. This includes the cost of renting your home or paying your mortgage (a mortgage is a long-term loan.) It also includes the often-high cost of heating your home and paying for electricity, telephone service and water.

#### If you rent

Many newcomers choose to rent an apartment on a monthly basis. Rental costs vary across cities and across Canada. They usually cost less outside large cities.

You will likely pay at least $350 a month to rent a room. You can pay at least $2,000 a month to rent a larger apartment or a large house. An [immigrant-serving organization](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/newcomers/services/index.asp) where you plan to settle can help you find a home that you can afford.

#### If you buy

If you want to buy a house, you will probably need to get a mortgage. Banks and other lending institutions give mortgage loans. They decide whether you have enough income, enough assets (things you own) and a good credit rating. Most banks will ask you to pay at least 10% of the cost of the house from your own money.

In addition to your mortgage payments, you will have to pay for property tax and household insurance. If you plan to purchase a condominium (condo), you will have to pay other fees.

You can compare the costs of housing in communities across Canada in the city profiles section of the [Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) website](https://www03.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/hmip-pimh/en#Profile/1/1/Canada).

#### Health insurance

Some provincial and territorial [health programs](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/new-life-canada/health-care-card.html) may not cover some newcomers for the first three months they are in Canada.

Check with the [ministry of health in your province or territory](www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/ptrole/index-eng.php) as soon as you arrive in Canada to see if you will need to buy extra health insurance.

#### Basic expenses

Food will be a basic expense. Costs will depend on the size of your family. This cost can double if you often eat in restaurants or choose to buy specialty items.

Clothing expenses may be less than 10% of your take-home pay. You may spend a lot more if you buy your clothing at designer stores. Second-hand shops sell used clothing and furniture at very low cost.

#### Alcohol and cigarettes

Some people include alcohol and cigarettes as part of their budget. Alcohol and cigarettes are expensive in Canada because they are heavily taxed.

#### Transportation

Many Canadian families have one or more cars. Canadians either buy their cars new or used or they lease them, which is a form of rental.

Make sure you think of all the costs before you decide to buy or lease a car. For example, when you own a car you will have to pay to keep it working well, for gas, monthly loan payments, registration and insurance. When you lease a car you will sign a contract to have the car for a set period of time. You will pay the same costs as you do when you own a car.

Many Canadians use public transportation, walk or bike.

#### Car insurance

It is the law that all cars must be insured and registered with your provincial or territorial government. Car insurance can be expensive, but it protects you and other drivers in case of an accident. In most provinces, you can find more information by contacting the [Insurance Bureau of Canada](www.ibc.ca/).

#### Be ready for occasional expenses

Living in Canada, you will find that every now and then you have to make payments for occasional expenses. Some examples:

- buying prescription medicine (not covered by health insurance)
- school supplies
- long-distance calls to friends and family in your home country

#### Pay cheque deductions

For most jobs in Canada, your employer will remove some money from your pay cheque. This is called a deduction. Pay cheque deductions can reduce your pay by as much as 25% to 35%. The money from these deductions usually pays for:

- [Income taxes](www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/fq/txrts-eng.html)
- [Canada Pension Plan](www.esdc.gc.ca/en/cpp/index.page) or [Quebec Pension Plan](www.rrq.gouv.qc.ca/en/programmes/regime_rentes/)
- [Employment Insurance](www.esdc.gc.ca/en/ei/index.page)
- Union dues (if you belong to a union)
- Payments to a retirement or pension plan (if you belong to a plan or choose to make contributions through your employer)
- Any other deductions you and your employer agree to in writing

Your pay cheque will show how much money has been deducted for each item. The total amount of your pay cheque before deductions is your gross income. The amount you get to keep is your net income or take-home pay.

#### Sales tax

Like many countries, Canada adds sales taxes to many of the goods and services you buy.

#### Goods and Services Tax (GST)

GST is a Government of Canada tax of 5% added to the price of most goods and services.

#### Provincial Sales Tax (PST)

PST is added to GST in most provinces and will range from an extra 7% to 10%. Alberta, Nunavut, Northwest Territories and Yukon do not have provincial or territorial sales tax.

#### Harmonized Sales Tax (HST)

Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Ontario combine the GST with the PST and call it the HST.

In Quebec, Revenu Québec administers the GST/HST and Quebec Sales Tax.
