**Choosing a program and school**

In Canada, each province and territory is in charge of their own education system.

- [Ministries and departments responsible for education](http://cicic.ca/1301/Ministries-Departments-responsible-for-education-in-Canada/index.canada) – information about the education system in each province and territory

**Primary and secondary schools**

Schools that teach students up to the grade 12 level are known as primary and secondary schools. Primary usually means grades 1-8 and secondary usually means grades 9-12.

All primary and secondary schools in Canada can enrol international students.

There are special rules for [minor children studying in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/minor-children.html).

**Post-secondary schools**

Post-secondary schools are:

- colleges
- universities
- private career colleges and
- vocational and technical schools

Each post-secondary school has its own set of rules on how to apply, including the level of English or French you need to be accepted.

Get more information on post-secondary schools:

- [Universities Canada](http://www.universitystudy.ca/) – profiles of Canadian universities, a large study programs database and help to plan your university education

Also visit [EduCanada](https://www.educanada.ca/programs-programmes/index.aspx?lang=eng) to get detailed profiles, requirements, application and admission information for programs of study at Canadian CEGEPs, vocational schools, colleges and universities.

**Important:** Each province and territory in Canada is responsible for designating schools at the post-secondary level that may enroll international students. The [designated learning institution list](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html) includes universities, colleges, CEGEPs, vocational schools and private career colleges and language schools. If you apply for a study permit and your letter of acceptance is from an institution that is **not designated** for international students, your application will be refused.

**Private career colleges**

Provincial governments do not necessarily regulate private schools. Make sure that the private school you apply to meets provincial education requirements and is included on the [designated learning institution list](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html).

**Language schools**

Many schools in Canada teach English or French as a second language. For more information about private language programs, contact [Languages Canada](http://www.languagescanada.ca/).

**Studying in French**

There are many ways to study in French across Canada.

- [French-language education in Canada](http://elf-canada.ca/en/) has information on schools and institutions that offer courses in French.
- The [Association des universités de la francophonie canadienne](http://www.acufc.ca/) has information on university programs in French, English, or both.

**Designated learning institutions**

Provinces and territories approve (or “designate”) schools that can enrol international students. These schools are known as designated learning institutions (DLI).

If you need a study permit, your acceptance letter must be from a DLI. If it isn’t, we will refuse your application.

All primary and secondary schools in Canada are DLIs. You can search a list of the post-secondary schools, such as colleges and universities, and language schools that have been designated.

[Find a designated learning institution](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html).

**How to apply to a school, college or university**

Once you choose a school, college or university, you must apply to go there. Every school has different rules on how to apply.

Make sure you apply at least

- six months in advance if you want to study at a primary or secondary school, or
- a year in advance for a post-secondary program

Contact the school where you want to study to learn how to apply. They will give you the list of all the documents you need to send them. Your school will be able to tell you about

- the cost to apply
- tuition fees
- health insurance
- rent and how much it costs to live in Canada
- language tests

Fill out the application forms for the school or schools of your choice. Follow their instructions to submit them.

If the school admits you as a student, they will send you a letter of acceptance. You need this letter to apply for a study permit.

**Health insurance**

The Government of Canada doesn’t pay for the medical costs of foreign students.

Health coverage for foreign students is different depending on where you live. Contact the school you are applying to for more information about health insurance.

## **Study permit**

**You need a provincial attestation letter to apply for a study permit**

As of 8:30 am ET on January 22, 2024, most students must include a provincial attestation letter (PAL) from the province or territory where they plan to study with their study permit application.

In most cases, if you apply without a PAL, your application will be returned with fees.

The study permit is a document we issue that allows [foreign nationals](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#foreign_national) to study at [designated learning institutions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html) (DLIs) in Canada.

- have [access to social services](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/minor-children.html#already) in some provinces or territories

**Proof of acceptance**

Your school must provide you with a letter of acceptance (LOA). Include the original **or** electronic copy of your letter with your study permit application.

**Post-secondary students**

Your school will be asked to make sure your letter of acceptance is valid.

If your school does not respond by the deadline, we’ll return your application and refund your processing fee. Confirm with your school that they will validate your letter of acceptance before resubmitting your application.

Make sure you **only** attach your LOA in the LOA-specific space when uploading documents for your online application. If you attach other documents in this space, you’re giving your consent to disclose these additional documents to your school. All other required documents should be attached in the corresponding spaces in your online application.

**Conditional acceptance and prerequisite courses**

If you’ve been conditionally accepted, you need to take prerequisite courses. For example, these might be English as a second language or French as a second language courses. You must complete these before you can start your main study program.

If this is the case, we’ll only issue your study permit for the length of those courses plus 1 year. Once you’re accepted into your main program, **you’ll need to apply for a new student permit to extend your stay as a student**.

**Exceptions**

If you’re the family member of someone who has a study permit or work permit application that’s been approved in writing before you come to Canada, you don’t need a letter of acceptance.

Most study permit applicants need to provide a provincial attestation letter (PAL) from the province or territory where they plan to study.

Unless you meet one of the [exceptions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/get-documents.html#exemptions), you must

- submit a PAL even if you’re applying for a prerequisite course or program, including language courses or programs
- submit a PAL for each study permit applicant, even if you’re applying as a family and submitting your applications together

**How to get a PAL**

- **For schools outside of Quebec**

**Provincial attestation letters are now available**

Contact your school to find out how to apply for a PAL. Once you have a PAL, you can apply for a study permit.

- **For schools in Quebec**

**Quebec Acceptance Certificate**

If you want to study in Quebec, you need an attestation of issuance of your **Quebec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ),** which is issued by the Government of Quebec. Contact your school to find out how to apply for the CAQ.

For your CAQ to act as your provincial attestation letter, it needs to include the following line:

“This attestation letter confirms that the applicant has a place in Quebec’s share of the distribution of study permit applications or is exempt from it.”

CAQs for applications received **before 8:30 a.m. ET on January 22, 2024,** do **not** require the above line.

Use the [application status tracker(opens in a new tab)](https://ircc-tracker-suivi.apps.cic.gc.ca/en) to get updates about your application. To create an account you need your

- [unique client identifier](https://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=013&top=4) (UCI)
- [application number](https://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1521&top=4)

**If we approve your application**

You’ll get your study permit

- at the port of entry when you arrive in Canada or
- mailed to you, if you’re already in Canada

**If you applied for your study permit from outside Canada**

We’ll send you a port of entry [letter of introduction](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#letter_of_introduction) that says you’re allowed to study in Canada. This letter is **not** your study permit.

You need to bring this letter with you and show it to a border services officer when you arrive in Canada. We’ll also send you an [electronic travel authorization (eTA)](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#electronic_travel_authorization) or a visitor visa ([temporary resident visa](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#temporary_resident_visa)) to enter Canada, if you need one.

If you’re from a country where you need an **eTA**, the letter of introduction will include information about your eTA. Your eTA will be linked to your passport and is valid for 5 years or until your passport expires, whichever comes first. It’s important that you travel with **the passport you used when you applied** for your study permit.

If you’re from a country where you need a **visitor visa**, the visa will be in your passport. It’ll show if you can enter Canada once or multiple times. You must enter Canada before your visa expires.

If you’re a lawful permanent resident of the United States, travel with a valid green card (or [equivalent official proof of status in the U.S.](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/entry-requirements-country.html#lawful-pr-us)) and a valid passport from your country of nationality (or an equivalent document).

**If you applied for your study permit from inside Canada**

**If you were eligible to apply from inside Canada**

We’ll mail your study permit to the Canadian address you included in your application.

**If you followed the instructions to apply for a study permit from outside Canada**

In this case, you filled out the form called Application for Study Permit Made Outside of Canada \[IMM 1294\]. If your application is approved, you’ll get an approval letter that says you’re allowed to study in Canada. This letter is called the **port of entry letter of introduction.**

Once you have this letter, you must leave and ask to get your study permit on return to Canada.

**Co-op work permits**

If you applied for a co-op work permit as part of your study permit application and you only received your study permit, follow the instructions for [how to apply as a **co-op student** or **intern**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/intern.html).

**If we refuse your application**

We’ll send you a letter explaining why.

We may refuse your application if you don’t

- have a [valid letter of acceptance](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/get-documents.html#loa-verification)
- show proof that you have enough money to support yourself while studying in Canada
- pass your medical exam, if you needed to get one
- convince the visa officer that your main purpose in Canada is to study or
- convince the visa officer that you’ll leave Canada at the end of your study period

If you have questions about why you were refused, contact the visa office that sent you the refusal letter.

**Prepare for your arrival**

**Before you come to Canada**

Before you arrive, read the [pre-departure guide](https://www.educanada.ca/study-plan-etudes/before-avant/guide.aspx?lang=eng) for tips and information about student life in Canada.

To help ensure a smooth arrival in Canada, please check the Canadian Border Service Agency’s [information for international students](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/pub/international-students-etudiants-etrangers-eng.html), and download their [PDF pamphlet (PDF, 592 KB)](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/pub/international-students-etudiants-etrangers-eng.pdf).

**How early can you arrive in Canada before you start studying**

There is no set time frame for you to arrive in Canada before you begin your studies. You should just arrive to give yourself a reasonable amount of time to prepare before you start studying.

You are **not allowed** to work on or off campus until you begin your studies in Canada.

**Changing your designated learning institution if you’re outside Canada**

If your application for a study permit has been approved and you change your designated learning institution, you must submit a new study permit application with a new letter of acceptance. You must also [pay all the fees](https://eservices.cic.gc.ca/epay/order.do?category=17) for the new application.

**When you arrive in Canada**

When you arrive in Canada, you’ll meet a [border services officer](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#border_services_officer) who will make sure you meet some basic requirements. To enter Canada, you must

- have a valid travel document, such as a passport
- have the port of entry [letter of introduction](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#letter_of_introduction) the visa office sent you when they approved your study permit

  - If you have a valid eTA, it’ll be linked to the passport you used to apply for your study permit.
- have enough money for your stay (the amount you will need can vary—it depends on things such as how long you will stay, and whether you will stay in a hotel, or with friends or relatives)
- be in good health
- have no criminal or immigration-related convictions
- convince an immigration officer that
  - you have ties—such as a job, home, financial assets or family—that will take you back to your home country

  - Your exam is valid for 12 months from the day you get it.
  - It must be valid the day you enter Canada.
  - If your exam will expire before you enter Canada, you need to [get another medical exam](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents.html).
    - This applies even if your letter of introduction is still valid.
- prove that you’ll leave Canada at the end of your stay

**If you need proof you entered Canada**

Your school or training facility may need you to prove you entered Canada. If you need proof of entry, make sure a border services officer stamps your passport before you leave Canadian customs. You may also be able to use a [Primary Inspection Kiosk](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/services/border-tech-frontiere/pik-bip-eng.html) to stamp your passport.

**Inadmissibility**

Some people are inadmissible—they’re not allowed to come to Canada. Several things can make you inadmissible, including involvement in criminal activity, in human rights violations or in organized crime.

You can also be inadmissible for security, health or financial reasons.

**While you study**

While you’re studying in Canada as an international student, you must meet the conditions of your study permit and keep your profile information updated in your online account. If your study program is ending soon, you also need to know how long you can stay in Canada and what to do if you plan to stay longer.

[](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/while-you-study.html)**Updating your profile information**

If information in your profile changes, **you must** update it in your online account.

You may need to update your profile if you

- change schools
- need to update documents or your contact information

**Changing schools**

Before you change your school or program, you must meet all the conditions of your study permit. This means you must be

- enrolled at a [designated learning institution (DLI)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html) **and**
- actively studying while you’re in Canada

You need to update your online account or contact us if you

- you’re from a country that requires a valid IME to enter Canada **and**
- your IME has expired or will expire while you’re outside of Canada

[Find out if you need an IME to return to Canada as an international student](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents/country-requirements.html).

**Changing the conditions of your study permit**

If you want to change a condition on your study permit, you must apply.

[Find more information about your study permit conditions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/while-you-study/study-permit-conditions.html).

**How long your study permit is valid**

A study permit is usually valid for the length of your study program, plus an extra 90 days. The 90 days let you either

- prepare to leave Canada or
- [apply to extend your stay](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/extend-stay/eligibility.html)

The amount of time you can stay in Canada after you’ve completed your studies depends on whether

- [you’re taking prerequisite courses](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/while-you-study.html#prereq-courses)
- [your study permit will expire before you finish your studies](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/while-you-study.html#before-expires)
- [you’ll finish your studies before your study permit expires](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/while-you-study.html#after-expires)

**If you’re taking prerequisite courses**

If your school asks you to take courses before they accept you into the main program (you have conditional acceptance), your study permit will be valid for the length of those courses plus 1 year.

When you get accepted into the main program, you must [apply to extend your stay as a student](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/extend-study-permit/how-to-apply.html).

**If your study permit will expire before you finish your studies**

If your study permit will expire **before** you finish your courses, you must [apply to extend your stay as a student](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/extend-study-permit/how-to-apply.html).

If you don’t, you’ll need to stop studying and leave Canada.

**If you’ll finish your studies before your study permit expires**

If you finish your studies early, your study permit will stop being valid **90 days after you complete your studies**, no matter what day is printed on the study permit.

Your studies are officially completed on the date your school first notifies you by any of the following:

- completion letter
- transcript
- degree or diploma

You must provide proof of the date your school notifies you **or** the date you get your degree, diploma or certificate. If you don’t have proof, we’ll use the earliest issue date on the document. We may confirm this date with your school.

**Staying in Canada after you graduate**

You may be able to [work temporarily or live permanently in Canada after you graduate](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation.html).

**Study permit conditions**

**Your study permit conditions**

**Changes to off-campus work hours**

You may be eligible to work more than 20 hours per week off campus under a temporary public policy. [Find out if you meet the requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/work-off-campus.html#off-campus).

As a study permit holder, you need to meet a number of conditions. If you don’t meet these conditions, you may lose your student status and study permit. You may also have to leave Canada.

As a study permit holder, you must:

- be enrolled at a [designated learning institution](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html) (DLI), unless you’re exempt
- show you’re actively pursuing your studies, unless you’re exempt, by
  - being enrolled full-time or part-time during each academic semester (excluding regularly scheduled breaks)
  - making progress towards completing your program’s courses, **and**
  - not taking [authorized leaves longer than 150 days](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/while-you-study/study-permit-conditions.html#s01.1) from your study program
- tell us any time you [change post-secondary schools](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/change-schools/account.html)
- end your studies if you no longer meet the requirements of being a student, **and**
- leave Canada when your permit expires

**Other study permit conditions you may need to follow**

You may have other conditions listed on your study permit. You must follow these conditions, which could include

- the level of studies
- if you’re allowed to [work on or off campus as a student](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work.html) in Canada
- if you need to report for medical procedures
- if you’re allowed to travel within Canada, and
- the date you must stop studying.

**If your school loses its DLI status**

If your school loses its DLI status after you get your study permit, you can keep studying at that school until your permit expires.

If you want to extend your study permit, you’ll need to enrol at a school with DLI status.

**If you’ve deferred your enrolment**

If you’ve deferred your enrolment and the DLI that issued your letter of acceptance is de-designated before you start studying, you cannot start studying at that school.

- If you’re in Canada with a valid study permit, you’ll need to
  - apply to and be accepted at a new DLI
  - update the information about your learning institution in MyAccount
- If your study permit has been approved but not issued yet
  - we’ll send you a request to provide a new letter of acceptance from a new DLI
  - you’ll need to update the information about your learning institution in MyAccount (if your study permit is approved)

**What counts as an authorized leave from your studies?**

There are a few cases where you may be able to take a leave of up to a **maximum of 150 days** from your program of studies and still be considered to be actively pursuing your studies.

You don’t need to tell us if you’re taking an authorized leave. However, if we ask for it, you must provide proof that your leave is

- **authorized** by your DLI and
- no longer than 150 days

It counts as authorized leave if

- your school has authorized a leave from your study program for
  - medical reasons or pregnancy
  - family emergency
  - death or serious illness of a family member
  - any other type of leave your school authorizes
- your school has closed permanently or because of a strike
- you’ve changed schools
- you or your school deferred your program start date
  - In this case, you must start your studies the next semester, even if it starts sooner than 150 days, and get an updated letter of acceptance.

**You can’t work on or off campus during an authorized leave from your study program, even if your study permit says you’re allowed to work in Canada.**

**How to prove that you meet your conditions**

We might ask you to prove you’re meeting your conditions:

- as part of a random check
- if we have reason to believe you’re not meeting them

We might ask you for:

- official documents from your school confirming:
  - your enrolment status
  - the reason for and start date of any leave you’ve taken
  - the date you withdrew from a school or study program
  - the date you were suspended or dismissed from a school or study program
  - the date you stopped studying at the school
- official transcripts
- references from people who know you
- proof from a medical professional confirming the medical need for a leave from your study program
- document confirming your school has closed and no longer offers your study program
- any other document an officer finds relevant

**If your classes were suspended or moved online because of COVID-19**

To prove you didn’t violate your study permit conditions, you can get a letter from your DLI stating that you

- stayed enrolled in your DLI, and
- participated in your studies online, if your DLI offered them

**What happens if you don’t meet your study permit conditions**

If we find you haven’t met your study permit conditions, we may ask you to leave Canada. You might also have to wait 6 months before you can apply for a new study permit (or for a visitor visa or work permit in Canada).

The outcome of any future applications you submit could be impacted if you do either of the following:

- you don’t follow your study permit conditions
- you work or study in a way we haven’t authorized

**People who are exempt from study permit conditions**

If you meet all of your [study permit conditions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/while-you-study/study-permit-conditions.html#s01), you get to keep your study permit and status as a student. However, some study permit holders are exempt from certain conditions.

You **don’t need to prove that you’re enrolled at a DLI or that you’re actively pursuing your studies** if:

Make sure you know what these conditions are.

**Medical exams and police certificates**

Depending on where you’re applying from, you may need to get a medical exam or police certificate. To get faster processing through the Student Direct Stream, you must include these with your application (if you need them). If you don’t, we won’t process your application faster.

**Who needs a medical exam**

You may need to get a medical exam if:

- you lived or travelled in [certain countries or territories](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents/country-requirements.html) for 6 or more months in the year before you come to Canada, or

  - the health field
  - primary or secondary education, or
  - child or elder care

To get a medical exam, you must see a [doctor that has been approved by IRCC](https://secure.cic.gc.ca/PanelPhysicianMedecinDesigne/en/Home).

**Who needs a police certificate**

Your visa office instructions will tell you if you need to get a police certificate. You’ll find these instructions when you select your country of residence below. Make sure you read these instructions before you apply, so you know if you need a police certificate or any other documents to apply.

[Find out more about police certificates](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/police-certificates/about.html).

**Language tests**

You must have a valid language test result that meets the minimum required score. Test results must be less than 2 years old when we receive your application. Tests must be taken **in-person**; online tests aren’t accepted.

Your [spouse](http://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/glossary.asp#spouse) or [common-law partner](http://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/glossary.asp#common_law_partner) and [dependent children](http://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/glossary.asp#dependent_child) may also be able to get faster processing on a

- visitor visa

- study permit

You must complete and submit their applications at the same time as your own. If you don’t, we will not process their applications faster. When you apply online, indicate that you have family members coming with you to Canada. This lets you complete their applications with yours.

**How to apply**

**Apply for a study permit through the Student Direct Stream**

You **must** apply online to get faster processing for your study permit. There’s no paper application for the Student Direct Stream. Make sure you include all the required documents with your application.

**You need a provincial attestation letter to apply for a study permit**

As of 8:30 am ET on January 22, 2024, most students must include a provincial attestation letter (PAL) from the province or territory where they plan to study with their study permit application.

In most cases, if you apply without a PAL, your application will be returned with fees.

[Learn more about the provincial attestation letter.](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/get-documents.html#attestation)

Before you apply online, make sure you have the following:

- [instruction guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-5269-applying-study-permit-outside-canada.html) to fill out your forms
- scanner or camera to create electronic copies of your documents
- valid [credit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/student-direct-stream/apply.html#centred-popup1) or [debit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/student-direct-stream/apply.html#centred-popup2) card to make a payment

**Pay your biometric fee**

In most cases, you [need to give your biometrics](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/visit/biometrics.asp). You should pay the biometric fee when you submit your application online. If you don’t pay this fee, we may not be able to process your application faster.

**After you apply**

**1\. You need to give your fingerprints and photo (biometrics)**

Once you pay your fees (including your biometrics fee) and submit your application, we’ll send you a letter that says you need to give your biometrics (if you need to). The letter will tell you how and where to do this. **You need to bring this letter when you give your biometrics. You also need to bring your valid passport.** You have up to 30 days to give your biometrics in person.

If you didn’t pay the biometrics fee, we’ll send you a letter asking you to do this first. You can only get the instruction letter if you pay the biometrics fee.

**2\. We process your study permit application**

Once we receive your biometrics, we’ll be able to process your study permit application. We process most Student Direct Stream applications within 20 calendar days after we receive your biometrics, if you meet the eligibility.

If your application doesn’t meet the eligibility for the Student Direct Stream, we’ll review it as a [regular study permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/eligibility.html). You won’t get faster processing if this happens.

Find out [how long it takes](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html) to process a regular study permit application.

**If we approve your application**

We’ll send you

- a port of entry [letter of introduction](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=845&top=25)
  - This isn’t your study permit. You need to show this letter to the officer when you arrive in Canada.
- an electronic travel authorization (eTA) **or** a visitor (temporary resident) visa, depending on which you need to enter Canada

**If you need an eTA**

Your letter of introduction will have information about it. Your eTA will be electronically linked to your passport and will be valid for 5 years or until your passport expires, whichever comes first. Make sure you travel with the passport you used to apply.

**If you need a visitor visa**

We’ll ask you to send your passport to the nearest visa office so we can attach your visa to it. Your visa will be in your passport and will show if you can enter Canada once or multiple times. You must enter Canada before your visa expires.

**Getting your study permit**

When you arrive at the port of entry, an officer will make sure you meet the requirements to enter Canada. If there are no problems, the officer will then print your study permit and give it to you. Make sure you have all the documents you need to enter Canada with you.

Find out [what happens when you arrive in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare-arrival.html) and what [your conditions are as an international student in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare-arrival/study-permit-conditions.html).

Your study permit is normally valid until the end of your school program. If your passport expires before the end of your study program, your permit will only be valid until your passport expiry date. If this happens, you’ll need to [apply to extend your study permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/extend-study-permit/when-to-apply.html) once you have a new passport.

If you have questions or there’s a mistake on your study permit, ask the officer before you leave.

**If we refuse your application**

We’ll send you a letter explaining why you were refused. If you have questions, [contact the office](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc/offices/international-visa-offices.html) that sent the refusal letter.

**Credit cards and prepaid cards**

We accept credit cards and prepaid cards from:

- Visa®
- MasterCard®
- American Express®
- JCB®
- UnionPay® (for online applications only; debit cards not accepted)

If you use a prepaid credit card, keep it for at least 18 months after you pay to make refunds easier. [Find more on prepaid cards](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1215&top=4).

We also accept all Visa Debit cards. The card you use doesn't have to be in your name. The cardholder’s name will appear on the receipt but it does not need to match your application.

## **Studying in Canada as a minor**

Find out what a minor child needs to do to study in Canada if they’re not a Canadian citizen or permanent resident.

**Who is a minor child**

Each province and territory decides the age when a person becomes an adult. This is known as the age of majority. A person under the age of majority is a “minor child”.

| **Province or territory**                                                                                      | **Age of majority** |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan                                         | 18                  |
| ---                                                                                                            | ---                 |
| British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Yukon | 19                  |
| ---                                                                                                            | ---                 |

**Caring for a minor child in Canada**

The parents or legal guardians must prove the minor child will have the care and support they need during their stay in Canada. Minor children under the age of 17 must either

- come with their parent or legal guardian or
- have a custodian in Canada

A custodian is a responsible adult, who is a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident, who will take care of and support the minor child. A custodian is optional for minors 17 years of age and older, but an officer can request one on a case-by-case basis.

**How to appoint a custodian**

To appoint a custodian, send us the [Custodianship Declaration form (PDF, 1.02 MB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/pub/custodian-parent.pdf), along with the minor child’s study permit application.

The 2 pages of the form look similar, but

- the first page needs to be signed by the custodian and notarized (certified by a lawyer or notary) **in Canada**
- the second page needs to be signed by the parents or legal guardians of the minor child and notarized **in their home country**

**Find out if your child needs a study permit**

The following table summarizes whether a minor child at the primary and secondary school level needs a study permit to enrol in a school. School authorities may also use the table to help determine when school fees apply.

**Why get a study permit if the minor doesn’t need one**

Having a study permit means, if the minor wants to, they may be able to

- [remain in school when they’re no longer a minor](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/eligibility.html#why-study-permit)
- get a secondary school [co-op work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/intern.html)
- [have access to social services in some provinces or territories](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/minor-children.html#already)

**Applying for a study permit for a minor**

Generally, if you’re applying for a study permit for a minor (even at the primary or secondary school level), you need to provide a letter of acceptance from the educational institution in Canada that the child is going to. You may provide either the original letter of acceptance or an electronic version.

Minor children don’t need a study permit for programs that are **6 months or less**, but may still apply for one before entering Canada.

Minor children who want to study for **6 months or more** must apply for a study permit before they enter Canada.

If you’re a lone parent applying for a minor, you may need additional documents when you submit the application. [Find out what documents you may need](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1654&top=15).

**Outside of Canada**

Minor children who want to study in Canada must [apply for a study permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/apply.html) before they enter Canada. This includes minor children who come with parents who already have a valid study or work permit.

Minors coming to Canada with parents who have a [valid](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#valid) study or work permit don’t need to provide a letter of acceptance from a school when applying for a study permit.

[Apply for a study permit outside Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/apply.html#outside_canada)

**Already in Canada**

Minors already in Canada should apply for a study permit. In some provinces or territories, they may need one to receive social services.

Minor children who are already in Canada may study **without a study permit** if they

- want to go to pre-school, kindergarten, or primary or secondary school and have a parent who is a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident of Canada
- are refugees or refugee claimants whose parents are refugees or refugee claimants
- came to Canada as a visitor for a course or program of studies of 6 months or less
- will study in a course or program of 6 months or less
- are in Canada by themselves or on a visitor status
- have a parent (biological or adoptive) who is authorized to work or study in Canada, including temporary residents who are
  - work permit holders
  - study permit holders
  - not physically in Canada
  - [business visitors](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/need-work-permit-work.html) and others authorized to [work without a work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/need-work-permit-work.html)

Minors who don’t have a study permit must have [valid](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#valid) visitor status during their stay in Canada.

**Applying for a study permit in Canada**

Minor children need a letter of acceptance if they’re

- in Canada with a family member **and**
- that family member had a work or study permit approved **before** they entered Canada

Study permits for primary school students are issued for a period of 1 year and can be renewed.

Study permits for students enrolled in secondary school (grades 9 to 12 in all provinces and territories except Quebec, and grades 9 to 11 in Quebec) can be issued for the full length of the intended period of study at a secondary school in Canada (maximum of 4 years).

**Extending a study permit in Canada**

Minor children need a letter of acceptance to [extend their study permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/extend-study-permit/how-to-apply.html) inside Canada. The length of a minor’s study permit is based on the letter of acceptance.

Make sure to apply for the new permit at least 90 days before the current permit expires. You can find your permit’s expiry date on the study permit itself.

**If their study permit expires**

Minor children must keep [valid](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#valid) status during their stay in Canada. Usually, this means having a valid study permit. If your minor child is allowed to study in Canada without a study permit, then they must have a valid [visitor visa](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/about-visitor-visa.html) or [Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eta.html).

If you haven’t applied to renew their study permit before it expires, they’ll lose their student status and have 90 days to apply to restore it. They’re allowed to continue studying until a decision is made.

**Footnotes**

**Footnote 1**

The child may have either a visitor record or a study permit. The child who is already in Canada is authorized to study without a study permit if they have only the visitor record or a Canadian entry stamp on their passport.

Your study permit will expire on **whichever date comes first:**

- the date marked on the permit or
- 90 days after the day you complete your studies

The 90 days begin

- on the date you get the first notification from your school (such as an email, letter, transcript, etc.) that you completed your program **or**

Family or staff of foreign representatives

You may not need a study permit if you’re a family or staff member of a foreign representative to Canada that has been accredited by Global Affairs Canada (GAC). Your embassy can contact [GAC](http://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/index.aspx?lang=eng) to find out if you need one.

While you’re studying in Canada as an international student, you must meet the conditions of your study permit and keep your profile information updated in your online account. If your study program is ending soon, you also need to know how long you can stay in Canada and what to do if you plan to stay longer.

Updating your profile information

- enrolled at a [designated learning institution (DLI)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html) and
- actively studying while you’re in Canada

- you’re from a country that requires a valid IME to enter Canada and
- your IME has expired or will expire while you’re outside of Canada

[Find out if you need an IME to return to Canada as an international student](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents/country-requirements.html).

Changing the conditions of your study permit

If you want to change a condition on your study permit, you must apply.

[Find more information about your study permit conditions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/while-you-study/study-permit-conditions.html).

How long your study permit is valid

A study permit is usually valid for the length of your study program, plus an extra 90 days. The 90 days let you either

- prepare to leave Canada or
- [apply to extend your stay](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/extend-stay/eligibility.html)

The amount of time you can stay in Canada after you’ve completed your studies depends on whether

- [you’re taking prerequisite courses](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/while-you-study.html#prereq-courses)
- [your study permit will expire before you finish your studies](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/while-you-study.html#before-expires)
- [you’ll finish your studies before your study permit expires](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/while-you-study.html#after-expires)

If you’re taking prerequisite courses

If your school asks you to take courses before they accept you into the main program (you have conditional acceptance), your study permit will be valid for the length of those courses plus 1 year.

When you get accepted into the main program, you must [apply to extend your stay as a student](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/extend-study-permit/how-to-apply.html).

If your study permit will expire before you finish your studies

If your study permit will expire before you finish your courses, you must [apply to extend your stay as a student](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/extend-study-permit/how-to-apply.html).

If you don’t, you’ll need to stop studying and leave Canada.

If you’ll finish your studies before your study permit expires

If you finish your studies early, your study permit will stop being valid 90 days after you complete your studies, no matter what day is printed on the study permit.

Your studies are officially completed on the date your school first notifies you by any of the following:

- completion letter
- transcript
- degree or diploma

You must provide proof of the date your school notifies you or the date you get your degree, diploma or certificate. If you don’t have proof, we’ll use the earliest issue date on the document. We may confirm this date with your school.

Staying in Canada after you graduate

You may be able to [work temporarily or live permanently in Canada after you graduate](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation.html).

**Get the right documents**

**Proof of acceptance**

**Letter of acceptance**

Your school must provide you with a letter of acceptance (LOA). Include the original or electronic copy of your letter with your study permit application.

Post-secondary students

Your school will be asked to make sure your letter of acceptance is valid.

If your school does not respond by the deadline, we’ll return your application and refund your processing fee. Confirm with your school that they will validate your letter of acceptance before resubmitting your application.

Make sure you only attach your LOA in the LOA-specific space when uploading documents for your online application. If you attach other documents in this space, you’re giving your consent to disclose these additional documents to your school. All other required documents should be attached in the corresponding spaces in your online application.

Conditional acceptance and prerequisite courses

If you’ve been conditionally accepted, you need to take prerequisite courses. For example, these might be English as a second language or French as a second language courses. You must complete these before you can start your main study program.

If this is the case, we’ll only issue your study permit for the length of those courses plus 1 year. Once you’re accepted into your main program, you’ll need to apply for a new student permit to extend your stay as a student.

Exceptions

If you’re the family member of someone who has a study permit or work permit application that’s been approved in writing before you come to Canada, you don’t need a letter of acceptance.

**Provincial attestation letter**

Most study permit applicants need to provide a provincial attestation letter (PAL) from the province or territory where they plan to study.

Unless you meet one of the [exceptions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/get-documents/provincial-attestation-letter.html#exemptions), you must

- submit your PAL with your application, not after
- submit a PAL even if you’re applying for a prerequisite course or program, including language courses or programs
- submit a PAL for each study permit applicant, even if you’re applying as a family and submitting your applications together

How long a PAL is valid for

Your PAL only needs to be valid when we receive it with your application. Unless your PAL has an expiry date on it, it’s valid until January 21, 2025. You can resubmit a study permit application with the same PAL if the PAL is still valid.

How to get a PAL

- For schools outside of Quebec

Provincial attestation letters are now available

Contact your school to find out how to apply for a PAL. Once you have a PAL, you can apply for a study permit.

- For schools in Quebec

Quebec Acceptance Certificate

If you want to study in Quebec, you need an attestation of issuance of your Quebec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ), which is issued by the Government of Quebec. Contact your school to find out how to apply for the CAQ.

For your CAQ to act as your provincial attestation letter, it needs to include the following line:

“This attestation letter confirms that the applicant has a place in Quebec’s share of the distribution of study permit applications or is exempt from it.”

CAQs for applications received before 8:30 a.m. ET on January 22, 2024, do not require the above line.

If you and 2 family members want to come to a province (other than Quebec) for a year, you will need $31,583 for living expenses.

**Quebec**

To study in Quebec, applicants must prove they meet the financial requirements outlined by the [ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration](https://www.quebec.ca/en/education/study-quebec/required-conditions/costs-studies).

- why you want to study in Canada
- that you understand your responsibilities as a student

You should include this letter if you decide to apply for a study permit, even if you don’t have to get a study permit for your program.

Medical exam

You may need a medical exam if any of these situations apply to you:

- You plan to stay in Canada for more than 6 months.
- You recently spent time in certain countries.

As of 8:30 am ET on January 22, 2024, most students must include a provincial attestation letter (PAL) from the province or territory where they plan to study with their study permit application.

In most cases, if you apply without a PAL, your application will be returned with fees.

[Learn more about the provincial attestation letter.](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/get-documents.html#attestation)

Generally, you must apply for a study permit **before you come to Canada**. Some people can apply for a study permit from within Canada. In some cases, you can apply when you arrive in Canada at the port of entry. Make sure you understand which option is available to you.

**Get your documents ready**

When you apply, you should submit

  - You can upload your PAL into the **Provincial attestation letter (required)** field in your application. If this option is missing, you must upload your PAL to the **Client information** field. If you meet an exception, you must provide any evidence in the **Client information** field.
- as many of the [documents needed for a complete application](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/get-documents.html) as possible

**If we approve your application**

You’ll get your study permit

- at the port of entry when you arrive in Canada or
- mailed to you, if you’re already in Canada

**If you applied for your study permit from outside Canada**

We’ll send you a port of entry [letter of introduction](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#letter_of_introduction) that says you’re allowed to study in Canada. This letter is **not** your study permit.

You need to bring this letter with you and show it to a border services officer when you arrive in Canada. We’ll also send you an [electronic travel authorization (eTA)](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#electronic_travel_authorization) or a visitor visa ([temporary resident visa](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#temporary_resident_visa)) to enter Canada, if you need one.

If you’re from a country where you need an **eTA**, the letter of introduction will include information about your eTA. Your eTA will be linked to your passport and is valid for 5 years or until your passport expires, whichever comes first. It’s important that you travel with **the passport you used when you applied** for your study permit.

If you’re from a country where you need a **visitor visa**, the visa will be in your passport. It’ll show if you can enter Canada once or multiple times. You must enter Canada before your visa expires.

If you’re a lawful permanent resident of the United States, travel with a valid green card (or [equivalent official proof of status in the U.S.](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/entry-requirements-country.html#lawful-pr-us)) and a valid passport from your country of nationality (or an equivalent document).

**Prepare for your arrival**

**Before you come to Canada**

Before you arrive, read the [pre-departure guide](https://www.educanada.ca/study-plan-etudes/before-avant/guide.aspx?lang=eng) for tips and information about student life in Canada.

To help ensure a smooth arrival in Canada, please check the Canadian Border Service Agency’s [information for international students](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/pub/international-students-etudiants-etrangers-eng.html), and download their [PDF pamphlet (PDF, 592 KB)](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/pub/international-students-etudiants-etrangers-eng.pdf).

**How early can you arrive in Canada before you start studying**

There is no set time frame for you to arrive in Canada before you begin your studies. You should just arrive to give yourself a reasonable amount of time to prepare before you start studying.

You are **not allowed** to work on or off campus until you begin your studies in Canada.

**Changing your designated learning institution if you’re outside Canada**

If your application for a study permit has been approved and you change your designated learning institution, you must submit a new study permit application with a new letter of acceptance. You must also [pay all the fees](https://eservices.cic.gc.ca/epay/order.do?category=17) for the new application.

**When you arrive in Canada**

When you arrive in Canada, you’ll meet a [border services officer](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#border_services_officer) who will make sure you meet some basic requirements. To enter Canada, you must

- have a valid travel document, such as a passport

  - If you have a valid eTA, it’ll be linked to the passport you used to apply for your study permit.

  - you have ties—such as a job, home, financial assets or family—that will take you back to your home country

  - Your exam is valid for 12 months from the day you get it.
  - It must be valid the day you enter Canada.
  - If your exam will expire before you enter Canada, you need to [get another medical exam](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents.html).
    - This applies even if your letter of introduction is still valid.
- prove that you’ll leave Canada at the end of your stay

**If you need proof you entered Canada**

Your school or training facility may need you to prove you entered Canada. If you need proof of entry, make sure a border services officer stamps your passport before you leave Canadian customs. You may also be able to use a [Primary Inspection Kiosk](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/services/border-tech-frontiere/pik-bip-eng.html) to stamp your passport.

**Inadmissibility**

Some people are inadmissible—they’re not allowed to come to Canada. Several things can make you inadmissible, including involvement in criminal activity, in human rights violations or in organized crime.

You can also be inadmissible for security, health or financial reasons.

**While you study**

While you’re studying in Canada as an international student, you must meet the conditions of your study permit and keep your profile information updated in your online account. If your study program is ending soon, you also need to know how long you can stay in Canada and what to do if you plan to stay longer.

**Updating your profile information**

If information in your profile changes, **you must** update it in your online account.

You may need to update your profile if you

- change schools
- need to update documents or your contact information

**Changing schools**

Before you change your school or program, you must meet all the conditions of your study permit. This means you must be

- enrolled at a [designated learning institution (DLI)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html) **and**
- actively studying while you’re in Canada

You need to update your online account or contact us if you

- are a [post-secondary student changing schools](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/change-schools.html#post-secondary) or
- have a co-op work permit and [have changed post-secondary schools to another co-op program](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1473&top=15#schools)

If you plan to leave Canada while you’re studying, you’ll need a new immigration medical exam (IME) to return if

- you’re from a country that requires a valid IME to enter Canada **and**
- your IME has expired or will expire while you’re outside of Canada

[Find out if you need an IME to return to Canada as an international student](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents/country-requirements.html).

**Changing the conditions of your study permit**

If you want to change a condition on your study permit, you must apply.

[Find more information about your study permit conditions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/while-you-study/study-permit-conditions.html).

**How long your study permit is valid**

A study permit is usually valid for the length of your study program, plus an extra 90 days. The 90 days let you either

- prepare to leave Canada or
- [apply to extend your stay](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/extend-stay/eligibility.html)

The amount of time you can stay in Canada after you’ve completed your studies depends on whether

- [you’re taking prerequisite courses](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/while-you-study.html#prereq-courses)
- [your study permit will expire before you finish your studies](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/while-you-study.html#before-expires)
- [you’ll finish your studies before your study permit expires](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/while-you-study.html#after-expires)

**If you’re taking prerequisite courses**

If your school asks you to take courses before they accept you into the main program (you have conditional acceptance), your study permit will be valid for the length of those courses plus 1 year.

When you get accepted into the main program, you must [apply to extend your stay as a student](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/extend-study-permit/how-to-apply.html).

**If your study permit will expire before you finish your studies**

If your study permit will expire **before** you finish your courses, you must [apply to extend your stay as a student](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/extend-study-permit/how-to-apply.html).

If you don’t, you’ll need to stop studying and leave Canada.

**If you’ll finish your studies before your study permit expires**

If you finish your studies early, your study permit will stop being valid **90 days after you complete your studies**, no matter what day is printed on the study permit.

Your studies are officially completed on the date your school first notifies you by any of the following:

- completion letter
- transcript
- degree or diploma

You must provide proof of the date your school notifies you **or** the date you get your degree, diploma or certificate. If you don’t have proof, we’ll use the earliest issue date on the document. We may confirm this date with your school.

**Staying in Canada after you graduate**

You may be able to [work temporarily or live permanently in Canada after you graduate](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation.html).

**Study Your study permit conditions**

Changes to off-campus work hours

You may be eligible to work more than 20 hours per week off campus under a temporary public policy. [Find out if you meet the requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/work-off-campus.html#off-campus).

As a study permit holder, you need to meet a number of conditions. If you don’t meet these conditions, you may lose your student status and study permit. You may also have to leave Canada.

As a study permit holder, you must:

- be enrolled at a [designated learning institution](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html) (DLI), unless you’re exempt
- show you’re actively pursuing your studies, unless you’re exempt, by
  - being enrolled full-time or part-time during each academic semester (excluding regularly scheduled breaks)
  - making progress towards completing your program’s courses, and
  - not taking [authorized leaves longer than 150 days](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/while-you-study/study-permit-conditions.html#s01.1) from your study program
- tell us any time you [change post-secondary schools](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/change-schools/account.html)
- end your studies if you no longer meet the requirements of being a student, and
- leave Canada when your permit expires

Other study permit conditions you may need to follow

You may have other conditions listed on your study permit. You must follow these conditions, which could include

- the level of studies
- if you’re allowed to [work on or off campus as a student](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work.html) in Canada
- if you need to report for medical procedures
- if you’re allowed to travel within Canada, and
- the date you must stop studying.

If your school loses its DLI status

If your school loses its DLI status after you get your study permit, you can keep studying at that school until your permit expires.

If you want to extend your study permit, you’ll need to enrol at a school with DLI status.

If you’ve deferred your enrolment

If you’ve deferred your enrolment and the DLI that issued your letter of acceptance is de-designated before you start studying, you cannot start studying at that school.

- If you’re in Canada with a valid study permit, you’ll need to
  - apply to and be accepted at a new DLI
  - update the information about your learning institution in MyAccount
- If your study permit has been approved but not issued yet
  - we’ll send you a request to provide a new letter of acceptance from a new DLI
  - you’ll need to update the information about your learning institution in MyAccount (if your study permit is approved)

What counts as an authorized leave from your studies?

There are a few cases where you may be able to take a leave of up to a maximum of 150 days from your program of studies and still be considered to be actively pursuing your studies.

You don’t need to tell us if you’re taking an authorized leave. However, if we ask for it, you must provide proof that your leave is

- authorized by your DLI and
- no longer than 150 days

It counts as authorized leave if

- your school has authorized a leave from your study program for
  - medical reasons or pregnancy
  - family emergency
  - death or serious illness of a family member
  - any other type of leave your school authorizes
- your school has closed permanently or because of a strike
- you’ve changed schools
- you or your school deferred your program start date
  - In this case, you must start your studies the next semester, even if it starts sooner than 150 days, and get an updated letter of acceptance.

You can’t work on or off campus during an authorized leave from your study program, even if your study permit says you’re allowed to work in Canada.

How to prove that you meet your conditions

We might ask you to prove you’re meeting your conditions:

- as part of a random check
- if we have reason to believe you’re not meeting them

We might ask you for:

- official documents from your school confirming:
  - your enrolment status
  - the reason for and start date of any leave you’ve taken
  - the date you withdrew from a school or study program
  - the date you were suspended or dismissed from a school or study program
  - the date you stopped studying at the school
- official transcripts
- references from people who know you
- proof from a medical professional confirming the medical need for a leave from your study program
- document confirming your school has closed and no longer offers your study program
- any other document an officer finds relevant

If your classes were suspended or moved online because of COVID-19

To prove you didn’t violate your study permit conditions, you can get a letter from your DLI stating that you

- stayed enrolled in your DLI, and
- participated in your studies online, if your DLI offered them

What happens if you don’t meet your study permit conditions

If we find you haven’t met your study permit conditions, we may ask you to leave Canada. You might also have to wait 6 months before you can apply for a new study permit (or for a visitor visa or work permit in Canada).

The outcome of any future applications you submit could be impacted if you do either of the following:

- you don’t follow your study permit conditions
- you work or study in a way we haven’t authorized

People who are exempt from study permit conditions

If you meet all of your [study permit conditions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/while-you-study/study-permit-conditions.html#s01), you get to keep your study permit and status as a student. However, some study permit holders are exempt from certain conditions.

You don’t need to prove that you’re enrolled at a DLI or that you’re actively pursuing your studies if:

- you or a family member (spouse or dependent child) has made a refugee claim in Canada that hasn’t yet been decided on
- you have refugee status in Canada
