## **Caregivers**

As a caregiver, you can come to Canada to become a permanent resident or work temporarily.

**Home Child Care Provider Pilot and Home Support Worker Pilot**

The Home Child Care Provider Pilot and the Home Support Worker Pilot are 5-year pilot programs that let qualified caregivers and their family members come to Canada with the goal of becoming permanent residents.

If you’ve been offered a job in Canada as a caregiver or have experience working in Canada as a caregiver, you may be able to apply for permanent residence through one of these pilots.

The application process will be different depending on your situation and **how much qualifying work experience you have**.

**Qualifying work experience**

Qualifying work experience means you’ve worked full-time in Canada in 1 of these [National Occupational Classification](http://noc.esdc.gc.ca/) (NOC) jobs:

**Home child care provider (NOC 44100)**

- You must care for children in your own home or in your employer’s private home.
  - The location can’t be an institutional setting such as a daycare.
- You don’t need to live in your employer’s home to qualify.
- Experience as a foster parent doesn’t count.

**Home support worker (NOC 44101)**

- You must care for someone who needs help from a home support worker in your employer’s private home.
  - The location can’t be an institutional setting such as a nursing home.
- You don’t need to live in your employer’s home to qualify.

If you applied before November 2022

**Tell us how much experience you have**

[**Less than 12 months**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/caregivers/child-care-home-support-worker/some-experience-about.html)

If you've never worked full-time as a caregiver in Canada or have less than 12 months of work experience, you can apply to the **Gaining experience category**.

[**12 months or more**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/caregivers/child-care-home-support-worker/complete-experience-about.html)

If you’ve worked full-time as a caregiver in Canada for a total of 12 months or more in the last 36 months, you can apply to the **Direct to permanence category**.

**Work temporarily as a caregiver**

You may be able to work as a **home child care provider** ([NOC 44100](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/Structure/NocProfile?objectid=wz4c29KaaGpuTryRqLAhMOHxCWe150wTW6bZTohsMTU%3D)) or **home support worker** ([NOC 44101](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/Structure/NocProfile?objectid=IC9YdwnmQtC72tbdrTt3hwW%2F2IcOggHJKJSwJqBcu%2B4%3D)) for an employer who has a positive labour market impact assessment (LMIA) through the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP). This type of work permit application for caregivers in Canada currently gets faster processing.

The information below only applies to home child care providers and home support workers. If you want to work in **another caregiver occupation**, [follow the normal process to work in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary.html).

**Apply for a new LMIA-based work permit**

**Who can apply**

You can [apply for a work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/apply.html) for a job as a home child care provider or home support worker through the TFWP if 1 of these applies to you:

1. You’re currently **outside Canada** and you’ll be **working in Quebec**.
2. You’re currently **in Canada** and 1 of these applies to you:
   - You have a **valid study or work permit**.
   - You’re **allowed to work in Canada** [**without a work permit**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/need-work-permit-work.html) (this does not apply to [business visitors](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=434&top=16)).
   - You plan to work in **Quebec** and you’re also [eligible to apply for a work permit from inside Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/eligibility.html#inside).

**Who can’t apply**

You can’t apply for this type of work permit in these cases:

1. You’re applying for a work permit from outside Canada through the TFWP and you plan to work in a province or territory other than Quebec.
2. You’re applying for a work permit at a port of entry.
3. You’re in Canada as a visitor.
   - You can only apply for a work permit as part of your permanent residence application under the [Home Child Care Provider Pilot or the Home Support Worker Pilot](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/caregivers/child-care-home-support-worker.html).
   - You may be able to apply for a LMIA-based work permit from inside Canada as a home child care provider or home support worker if you plan to work in Quebec. You must still meet [the eligibility criteria](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/eligibility.html#inside).
   - You may still be able to get a work permit as a visitor for another occupation. [Find out if you’re eligible](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/apply.html) and how to apply.

**How to apply**

Your employer will need to [get a positive LMIA](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/foreign-workers/caregiver/apply.html) first. Once they have a positive LMIA, you can [apply for a work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/work-permit.html).

**Extend your work permit or change jobs**

If you’re currently working in Canada and have a valid work permit, you may be eligible to

- extend your current work permit
- change jobs or employers

Your employer will need to [get a positive LMIA](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/foreign-workers/caregiver/apply.html) first. Once they have a positive LMIA, you can [apply to extend or change the conditions on your work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/extend.html).

It’s important that you extend your work permit or change its conditions before it expires.

**If you applied for a new work permit before your previous one expired**

**If you're working for the same employer**

**If you applied to the gaining experience category of the Home Child Care Provider or Home Support Worker pilots**

**If you’re changing jobs or employers**

**If you didn’t extend your work permit before it expired**

If your work permit has expired and you lost your temporary resident status, you may be able to [restore your status](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/restore.html) as a worker.
