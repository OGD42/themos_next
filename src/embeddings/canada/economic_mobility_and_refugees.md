## **Economic Mobility Pathways Pilot**

The Economic Mobility Pathways Pilot (EMPP) combines refugee resettlement and economic immigration. It’s a pathway that

- helps skilled refugees immigrate to Canada through existing economic programs
- gives employers access to a new pool of qualified candidates to fill job openings

**How the pilot works**

**The Economic Mobility Pathways Pilot** (EMPP) helps skilled refugees and other displaced people immigrate to Canada.

**We made some updates to make it easier to apply to immigrate to Canada through the EMPP.**

There are now 2 ways you can apply for the EMPP:

1. through one of 3 selected economic programs
   - [Atlantic Immigration Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/how-to-immigrate/eligibility.html)
   - [Provincial Nominee Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/provincial-nominees/non-express-entry/eligibility.html)
   - [Rural and Northern Immigration Program (RNIP)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/rural-northern-immigration-pilot/pr-eligibility.html)
   - This is referred to as the **regional EMPP**. You need to be eligible for one of the above programs and apply first to a province, territory or RNIP community (depending on which program you choose.)
2. directly to us for just the EMPP  
   This is referred to as the **federal EMPP**. It includes a Job Offer and No Job Offer stream. You need to meet the work experience, education and language requirements.

Through the EMPP, we’ll

- waive application and biometric fees for you and your dependants
- review and process your application in 6 months or less (in most cases)
- cover the cost of medical exams through the [Interim Federal Health Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-within-canada/health-care/interim-federal-health-program/coverage-summary.html)
- let you access the Immigration Loans Program (ILP), if we approve your application, to help with
  - travel costs
  - some pre-arrival travel services from the International Organization for Migration
  - the right of permanent residence fee
- let you access the EMPP-specific Canadian Orientation Abroad Programme to help you settle in Canada

If you choose to apply for an economic immigration program through the regional EMPP, we’ll also

- make it easier for you to be eligible and apply for the program
- let you [use a loan to meet financial requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/economic-mobility-pathways-pilot/immigrate/eligibility.html#loan) to support yourself and your family in Canada (your settlement funds)

**Who can apply**

There are 3 sets of eligibility requirements you must meet to apply for the EMPP.

**1\. You must be a refugee or displaced person**

To prove this, you must have **one** of these documents

- a positive Refugee Status Determination (RSD) from the UN Refugee Agency or a refugee-hosting state
- proof you’re registered or recorded as a person of concern by the UN Refugee Agency
- a refugee certificate from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine in the Near East (UNRWA)
- proof of being registered or recorded as a person of concern with UNRWA
- proof you have temporary protected status and a copy of the completed durable solution information form (IMM 0195)
  - If you apply with a temporary protected status document, an officer will need to assess your case and decide if you don’t have a durable solution.

If you don’t have any of the above documents, [one of our trusted partners](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/economic-mobility-pathways-pilot/immigrate/apply.html) can

- assess your eligibility as a refugee or displaced person and
- issue you a referral letter, if they find you meet the criteria

You must be living outside Canada when you apply to the EMPP.

**2\. You must meet the criteria depending on how you’ll apply**

**Apply based on your work experience, education and language skills (the Federal EMPP)**

**Apply through an economic immigration program (the regional EMPP)**

**If you need a loan for your settlement funds**

If you’re applying for an economic immigration program through the regional EMPP, you may be able to get a loan to cover your settlement funds.

We’ve partnered with Windmill Microlending to offer low-interest microloans to eligible EMPP candidates who

- have a job offer and
- don’t have the minimum funds needed to meet their immigration program financial eligibility requirements

[Find out how to apply for this loan](https://windmillmicrolending.org/empp/).

You **can’t use** the [Immigration Loans Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-within-canada/financial.html#loansProgram) to cover your proof of settlement funds.

**3\. Admissibility**

You must be [admissible to Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/inadmissibility.html).

You can apply for the Economic Mobility Pathways Pilot (EMPP)

- on your own, or
- with help from a non-government partner

There are partner organizations outside government that can help you

- connect to employers in Canada
- prepare for a job offer, then apply for the EMPP

These partners include

- [TalentLift](https://www.talentlift.ca/)
- [Talent Beyond Boundaries](https://www.talentbeyondboundaries.org/)
- [Jumpstart Refugee Talent](https://jumpstartrefugee.ca/)
- [RefugePoint](https://www.refugepoint.org/)
- [HIAS](https://www.hias.org/)
- [FOCUS Humanitarian Assistance](https://www.focus-canada.org/home/)
- [International Rescue Committee](https://www.rescue.org/)
- [World University Service of Canada](https://wusc.ca/)

**1\. Get ready to apply**

You have to submit proof of your current refugee situation with 1 of these

- a positive Refugee Status Determination (RSD) from the UN Refugee Agency or a refugee-hosting state
- proof you’re registered or recorded as a person of concern by the UN Refugee Agency, if you don’t have a positive RSD yet or you can’t get one in the country you’re in
- a refugee certificate with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)
- proof of being registered or recorded as a person of concern by the UNRWA, if a refugee certificate has not been obtained yet
- proof you have temporary protected status and a copy of the completed durable solution information form (IMM 0195)
  - If you apply with a temporary protected status document, an officer will need to assess your case and decide if you don’t have a durable solution.

If you don’t have any of these documents, you can work with a partner who can issue you a “trusted partner referral letter.”

**Get a referral letter from a partner**

The partners that can issue a “trusted partner referral letter” make sure you

- meet the definition of a [convention refugee](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#convention_refugee) or [country of asylum refugee](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#member_of_the_country_of_asylum_class)
  - they don’t need to do this if you have a temporary protected status (TPS) document
- have no durable solution

They will then issue you a trusted partner referral letter. You include this letter with your application.

Partners that can provide this letter are

- [TalentLift](https://www.talentlift.ca/)
- [Talent Beyond Boundaries](https://www.talentbeyondboundaries.org/)
- [Jumpstart Refugee Talent](https://jumpstartrefugee.ca/)

Other partner organizations can help you apply, but they can’t issue a trusted partner referral letter.

**2\. Complete the application**

You can complete your applications yourself (or with a partner). If you decide to use an immigration representative, [make sure you know how to choose one](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigration-citizenship-representative/choose.html).

**If you apply based on your work experience, education and language skills (the federal EMPP)**

You only need to complete 1 application, whether or not you have a job offer.

[Complete your application for the EMPP](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/economic-mobility-pathways-pilot/immigrate/economic-mobility-application.html)

**If you apply through an economic immigration program (the regional EMPP)**

There are 2 applications you must complete using this process:

1. An application for one of the economic immigration programs
   - Atlantic Immigration Program
   - Provincial Nominee Program
   - Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot
2. An [application for the regional EMPP](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/economic-mobility-pathways-pilot/immigrate/economic-mobility-application.html)
   - If you’re eligible, you’ll
     - apply online using the permanent residence portal
     - complete and submit both online applications together
   - If you can’t apply using the portal, we’ll accept applications by email.

**After you apply**

**How we process your application**

Once we receive your Economic Mobility Pathways Pilot (EMPP) application, we’ll review it in 2 stages.

While your application is being processed, you must tell us if you [change your address](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/change-address.html) or [contact information](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/contacts/web-form.asp).

**Stage 1: We check that all required forms are included**

In this phase, we’ll review your application to make sure all of the required forms were signed and included. We won’t be reviewing to make sure all supporting documents are also included.

**If all the required forms were signed and included**, we’ll email you (or your [representative](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigration-citizenship-representative/learn-about-representatives.html)) an **acknowledgement of receipt** (AOR) that includes your application number. This confirms that we added your application to our system.

**If any forms are not signed or are missing**, we’ll email you (or your [representative](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigration-citizenship-representative/learn-about-representatives.html)) to let you know that your application isn’t complete and the reasons why. We’ll tell you if you can send us the missing documents, or if you need to resubmit your application. We won’t add your application to our system and you won’t receive an AOR.

**Stage 2: We review if you’re eligible and admissible to Canada**

If all your forms are signed and included, we’ll begin processing your application.

**If you applied through an immigration program (regional EMPP)**

We’ll review your application to see if you are a refugee or displaced person. We do this to make sure you can access the facilitation measures the EMPP offers for your immigration program application.

If you are eligible, we’ll review your application to make sure you meet the requirements of the economic immigration program you applied to. If you do, we’ll continue processing your application.

**If you applied through a job offer or non job offer stream (federal EMPP)**

We’ll review your application to see if you’re eligible for the EMPP. If you’re eligible, we’ll continue processing your application.

**Processing your application**

You may need to attend an interview to provide more information. This also applies to any family members who will be coming with you to Canada. If we ask you to come for an interview, we’ll tell you the date, time, location, and what documents to bring with you. You and your family members must give your fingerprints and photo ([biometrics](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/campaigns/biometrics/facts.html)) at this interview.

If you aren’t eligible for the EMPP, we’ll let you know. If you’re still interested in immigrating to Canada, you can complete and submit a new application. You’ll need to show how you are eligible for any program you choose to apply to, without the EMPP.

**Admissibility to Canada**

Once we confirm you’re eligible for the program, we’ll review your application to make sure you’re admissible to Canada. This means we’ll check to make sure you pass

- a medical exam
- security checks
- criminality checks

At this point, you and any family members coming with you to Canada must complete [immigration medical exams](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-permanent-residents.html).

**You should only do your medical exams when we ask you to**. When we ask you to complete your exams, we’ll send you

- medical forms for you and any family members you include in your application
- instructions about finding a doctor in your area who is authorized to do immigration medical exams

The fees for your medical exam will be covered by the [your temporary medical insurance](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-within-canada/health-care/interim-federal-health-program/services.html). You’ll get an eligibility document you’ll need to show to a doctor to confirm your coverage.

To access a doctor who will accept your temporary medical insurance coverage

- go to [our online tool to search for doctors](https://secure.cic.gc.ca/pp-md/pp-list.aspx) near you
- look for the note “This panel physician or clinic provides services paid by Interim Federal Health Program”

**Reasons your application could be delayed**

Your application could be delayed if

- your contact information is missing or out-of-date
- your application is incomplete
- the documents you send us
  - are unclear or don’t meet specifications
  - don’t have a certified English or French translation
- there are any criminal or security problems, or we need to do more background checks
- your family situation isn’t clear or has changed and you didn’t let us know (this could include a divorce, an adoption that isn’t complete or child custody issues that haven’t been resolved)
- the processing office has to contact other IRCC offices in or outside Canada to confirm the information you provided
- you don’t include your application number when you contact us
- there are any issues getting an exit permit for the country you’re living in

**Getting your permanent resident status**

If we approve your application, we’ll issue you (and your family members, if applicable):

- a visa for travel to Canada **or** a single journey travel document that will allow you travel to Canada (if you don’t have a valid passport), and
- a confirmation of permanent residence (COPR)

Make sure you pay your right of permanent residence fee (if you haven’t already). You can either pay this fee yourself or [apply for a loan to cover this cost](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/immigration-loans-program/right-permanent-residence-rprf-loan.html).

If you told us on your application that you would like the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to arrange your transportation to Canada, we’ll let the IOM know. They’ll contact you directly with more information.

If the country you live in requires you to get an exit permit, you must apply and pay for this before you can leave for Canada.

**Prepare to arrive in Canada**

**Before you arrive in Canada**

Before you arrive, we’ll give you access to the [Canadian Orientation Abroad programme](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/partners-service-providers/immigrant-serving-organizations/best-practices/canadian-orientation-abroad.html). This is a general orientation to life in Canada that will

- help you prepare for your move
- connect you to free settlement services after you arrive in Canada, such as language training

**After you arrive in Canada**

**Help for new immigrants**

There are many services to help you or your family

- learn or improve English and French
- find a job (if you don’t have one already)
- find activities in your new community

Find out [what services are available in your area](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/newcomers/map/services.asp). You can also learn more about [starting your life in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/new-life-canada.html).

**Confirm your permanent resident status**

You’ll need to confirm your [permanent resident (PR) status](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card/understand-pr-status.html). In most cases, you can do this through our secure online Permanent Residence Portal.

You don’t have to do anything until we send you an email from an address ending in **cic.gc.ca**. **Do not create your own account.**

Once we contact you, follow the [instructions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/pr-confirmation-portal.html) to confirm your PR status online.

**You must tell us if you leave Canada before we grant you PR status.**

**Make sure you keep your information up to date**

Use the [web form](https://services3.cic.gc.ca/ecas/?app=coanotify&lang=en) if you need to update your contact information or tell us about changes to your family situation (for example, marriage, birth, divorce or death).

**Get your permanent resident card**

Once you become a permanent resident, we’ll make an electronic confirmation of permanent residence (e-COPR) available to you in the Permanent Residence Portal. This document is proof of your new status in Canada.

In the portal, we’ll also ask you to provide a photo so we can start the process of issuing your first [PR card](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card.html). You don’t need to apply for your first PR card.

While you wait for your PR card, you can use your signed e-COPR to

- prove you’re a permanent resident in Canada
- apply for government benefits and services
  - Like your [social insurance number](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin.html) so you can work.

**Find out about assistance loans**

Once you arrive in Canada, you may be able to get an assistance loan if you need one. To do so, send a message to [IRCC.INEMPP-PVAMERI.IRCC@cic.gc.ca](mailto:IRCC.INEMPP-PVAMERI.IRCC@cic.gc.ca) and include:

- **Subject line:** EMPP request for assistance loan
- **Body of email:**
  - your application number (you can find this on correspondence from us)
  - number of people in your application, including yourself
  - your email address

  - name of your employer in Canada (if this applies)

## **Refugees and asylum**

Apply for refugee status from within Canada, find out how to come to Canada as a refugee, sponsor a refugee, find refugee services in Canada, and learn about how the system works.

## **Asylum – refugee protection from in Canada**

**About the process**

**Refugee status**

Canada offers refugee protection to some people in Canada who fear persecution or who would be in danger if they had to leave. Some dangers they may face include

- torture
- risk to their life
- risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment

If you feel you could face one of these risks if you go back to your home country or the country where you normally live, you may be able to seek protection in Canada as a refugee.

**Who can apply**

**Safe Third Country Agreement remains in effect**

The STCA and the Additional Protocol continue to be in effect. People entering Canada from the US along the land border

- are still not eligible to make a refugee claim
- will be returned to the US unless they meet 1 of the relevant exemptions or exceptions under the STCA

[Learn more about the recent Supreme Court of Canada decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2023/06/statement-from-minister-fraser-concerning-the-supreme-courts-decision-on-the-safe-third-country-agreement.html).

**Changes to the Safe Third Country Agreement**

On March 24, 2023, Canada and the United States [announced the expansion of the STCA](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/agreements/safe-third-country-agreement.html) across the entire land border, including internal waterways. The expansion takes effect as of 12:01 a.m. EDT on March 25, 2023. If you crossed the border to make an asylum (refugee) claim and don’t meet one of the Agreement’s exceptions, you’ll be returned to the U.S.

**Who can make a refugee claim**

To make a refugee claim, you

- must be **in Canada**
- can’t be subject to a removal order

If you’re outside Canada, you may be eligible to

- [resettle in Canada as refugee](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-outside-canada.html)
- [immigrate to Canada through one of our programs](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada.html)

**Eligibility**

If you make a refugee claim, we’ll decide if it can be referred to the [Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB](https://irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/Pages/index.aspx)). The IRB is an independent tribunal that makes decisions on immigration and refugee matters.

Your refugee claim may not be eligible to be referred to the IRB if you

- are recognized as a Convention refugee by another country that you can return to
- were granted protected person status in Canada
- arrived via the [Canada–United States border](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/agreements/safe-third-country-agreement.html)
- have made a refugee claim in another country, as confirmed through information-sharing
- are not admissible to Canada on security grounds or because of criminal activity or human rights violations
- made a previous refugee claim that was not found eligible
- made a previous refugee claim that was rejected by the IRB
- abandoned or withdrew a previous refugee claim

The IRB decides who is a **Convention refugee** or a **person in need of protection**.

**Convention refugees** are outside their home country or the country they normally live in. They’re not able to return because of a well-founded fear of persecution based on

- race
- religion
- political opinion
- nationality
- being part of a social group, such as women or people of a particular sexual orientation

A **person in need of protection** is a person in Canada who can’t return to their home country safely. This is because, if they return, they may face

- danger of torture
- risk to their life
- risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment

The IRB website has more information on [making an asylum claim in Canada](http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/Eng/RefClaDem/Pages/ClaDem.aspx).

**Safe Third Country Agreement**

Canada has an agreement with the U.S. that says people who want to make a refugee claim must do so in the first safe country they arrive in.

This means, you’ll be returned to the U.S. if you

- enter Canada from the U.S. at a land port of entry, or
- cross between ports of entry along the land border, including waterways that run along and across it, and make a refugee claim less than 14 days after the day of entry

In some cases, this [rule does not apply](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/agreements/safe-third-country-agreement.html) (for example, if you have family in Canada).

**Before you make a refugee claim**

Principio del formulario

Answer a few questions to see if you can make a refugee claim.

**After you apply**

**If you make your claim at a port of entry**

There are 4 possible results when you make a claim at a port of entry. Your next steps will depend what our Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officer decides to do after reviewing your claim.

1. **The CBSA officer decides your claim is eligible**

You’ll receive a notice from the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) about a hearing. You must

- - complete your medical exam, and
    - [go to your hearing](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/asylum/claim-protection-inside-canada/after-you-apply.html#eligible) with the IRB

1. **The officer schedules you for an interview**

You must

You must

- - complete your claim online, and
    - complete your medical exam

To complete your claim online, you’ll need your

- - application number

Keep any of these documents the CBSA gives you. The CBSA will tell you what to do next.

1. **The officer decides your** [**claim is not eligible**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/asylum/claim-protection-inside-canada/after-you-apply.html#not-eligible)

**If you submit your claim online**

After you submit your claim online, we’ll review it to make sure it’s complete. If it is, we’ll use your online account to send you:

- an **acknowledgement of claim** letter (which will help you get access to the [Interim Federal Health Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-within-canada/health-care/interim-federal-health-program/services.html) and [other services in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-within-canada.html))
- instructions to complete your medical exam
- a letter with [details about an in-person appointment](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/asylum/claim-protection-inside-canada/after-you-apply.html#appointment), once we schedule it
  - You may not get this letter at the same time as your acknowledgement of claim letter. We’ll send it to you only once we schedule your appointment.

If your claim is incomplete, we’ll tell you what’s missing.

You’ll get an email if we update your account or upload a document for you. Make sure you check your email regularly.

**Go to your appointment**

Make sure you bring your original passport or any other identification documents you have to your appointment.

During your appointment, we’ll

- review your application
- collect your fingerprints and photo ([biometrics](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/campaigns/biometrics/facts.html)) and any required documents (if you haven’t already provided them)
- conduct your eligibility interview to decide if your claim is eligible (if we can)
- give you documents about next steps

If your child is under 14, bring 2 passport-sized photos to the biometrics appointment. Anyone 14 and older **doesn’t** need to bring photos.

If we don’t make a decision about your claim during this appointment, we’ll schedule you for an interview and give you the details. It’s mandatory to [go to your interview](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/asylum/claim-protection-inside-canada/after-you-apply.html#interview).

**Go to your interview**

**Changes to immigration related appointments**

**If you’re in Canada**

Any in-person appointments that were rescheduled due to the Government of Canada labour disruption are in the process of being rescheduled. You will be notified of your new appointment as soon as possible.

**If you’re outside Canada**

Overseas interviews are proceeding as scheduled, unless indicated otherwise by the IRCC office abroad.

During your interview we’ll decide if your claim is eligible. If we decide it is, we’ll refer it to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB).

After the interview, we’ll give you a **refugee protection claimant document** that matches our decision about your claim. If your claim is eligible, we’ll also give you a **confirmation of referral** letter that confirms we referred your claim to the IRB. These documents will help you

- prove you are a refugee claimant in Canada
- get access to the [Interim Federal Health Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-within-canada/health-care/interim-federal-health-program/services.html) and [other services in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-within-canada.html)

**If your claim is eligible**

**Go to your hearing**

If we refer your claim to the IRB, the IRB will send you a notice to appear for a [hearing](https://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/applying-refugee-protection/Pages/index4.aspx). This notice will tell you

- where to go for your hearing
- when to get there
- when it starts

Find out how to prepare for your hearing in the [IRB’s Claimant’s Guide](https://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/refugee-claims/Pages/ClaDemGuide.aspx).

After your hearing, the IRB will approve or refuse your refugee claim. [Find out what to do after you get a decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/asylum/claim-protection-inside-canada/after-you-apply.html#after-hearing).

The IRB will **never** call you to ask for money. Read more [information about fraudulent calls demanding money](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugee/news/2017/12/government_of_canadawarningrefugeeandimmigrantcommunitiestobewar.html).

**After your hearing**

After your refugee hearing, the IRB approves or rejects your refugee claim.

**If the IRB accepts your claim**, you get “protected person” status. This means you can stay in Canada, and you can [apply to become a permanent resident of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-5205-applying-permanent-residence-within-canada-protected-persons-convention-refugees.html).

**If the IRB rejects your claim**, you’ll have to leave Canada. You may be eligible to appeal the IRB’s decision. You may also have [other options](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/claim-protection-inside-canada/after-apply-next-steps/refusal-options.html).

**If your claim is not eligible**

If your claim is ineligible, your claim won’t be referred to the IRB and you’ll be issued an enforceable [removal order](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/security-securite/rem-ren-eng.html) to leave Canada.

**Work and study permits**

**Faster work permits for asylum claimants**

As of November 16, 2022, we’ll process [work permits for asylum claimants](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/refugee-work-permits.html) once we find them eligible and before we refer them to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada.

Before we issue a work permit, claimants must still

- provide all required information (in the Canadian Refugee Protection Portal or IRCC Portal)
- complete an immigration medical exam
- give biometrics

## **Refugee appeals**

​​​​​​​​​​​​​Launched on December 15, 2012, the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) considers appeals against decisions of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) to allow or reject claims for refugee protection. In most cases, there will be no hearing as the RAD will base its decision on the documents provided by the parties involved and the RPD record.

**Procedures and practice notices**

​Each division of the IRB is responsible for making decisions on different immigration or refugee matters. To make their decisions, they follow an administrative tribunal process. This process is like what happens in a court, but less formal. The process is flexible.

**Procedures** and **practice notices** are used to provide information to parties and counsel appearing before the IRB. They explain the IRB's processes and set out steps that parties and the IRB should follow in certain situations. ​

Some procedures and practice notices apply to all divisions of the IRB, while some only apply to a single division.

**Decisions**

The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) is Canada's largest independent administrative tribunal. Every year, the Board renders about 70,000 decisions on refugee protection and immigration matters.

**About Board decisions**

Under the [Immigration and Refugee Protection Act](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http://www.laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/index.html&data=05%7c01%7cAtlas%40irb-cisr.gc.ca%7c1570b493324f4f92c6ba08dbbdcaff23%7ca65e50e1a948479b8fedf4e96b62098d%7c0%7c0%7c638312451787351858%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c3000%7c%7c%7c&sdata=3nMkKf47ctvzG%2BGpsB3WBm/FhvwGU7zsVEJqV3Qigv0%3D&reserved=0), proceedings before the Immigration Division (unless they involve a refugee claimant) and the Immigration Appeal Division are generally held in public. A case may be heard in private when there is a serious possibility that the life, liberty and security of a person will be endangered if the proceeding is held in public, or for reasons of fairness or public security, as set out in section 166 of the Act. Proceedings before the Refugee Protection Division and the Refugee Appeal Division are generally conducted in the absence of the public (i.e., in private).

When a case is heard in private but made public (e.g., in the case of persuasive decisions or other decisions published on CanLII), all the information that could identify the person who is the subject of the proceedings is redacted.

**​​Policy making in the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada**

The scope and scale of the task the IRB has in adjudicating a diverse range of immigration and refugee matters in four Divisions means that the Board cannot rely solely on the guidance that legislation and judicial decisions provide. The [Immigration and Refugee Protection Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/) and [Regulations](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/) provide general guidance, but leave much latitude for interpretation. Judicial guidance is also limited: IRB decisions are subject to judicial review by the Federal Court, but only with leave and the judicial review process does not resolve every ambiguity or gap in law or practice. Where it considers advisable, the IRB seeks to fill this gap through mechanisms it has generated to improve the quality of the justice it delivers. Its efforts in this regard constitute policy-making.

**For asylum seekers: What you need to know**

**Changes to the Safe Third Country Agreement**

On March 24, 2023, Canada and the United States [announced the expansion of the STCA](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/agreements/safe-third-country-agreement.html) across the entire land border, including internal waterways. The expansion takes effect as of 12:01 a.m. EDT on March 25, 2023. If you crossed the border to make an asylum (refugee) claim and don’t meet one of the Agreement’s exceptions, you’ll be returned to the U.S.

**Safe Third Country Agreement remains in effect**

The STCA and the Additional Protocol continue to be in effect. People entering Canada from the US along the land border

- are still not eligible to make a refugee claim
- will be returned to the US unless they meet 1 of the relevant exemptions or exceptions under the STCA

[Learn more about the recent Supreme Court of Canada decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2023/06/statement-from-minister-fraser-concerning-the-supreme-courts-decision-on-the-safe-third-country-agreement.html).

Seeking asylum is not a shortcut to get around normal immigration rules and procedures. There must be legitimate reasons why asylum is necessary or it won’t be granted.

Canada respects its international obligations toward those who genuinely need help and protection. However, we must also make sure that all laws are followed to protect the safety, security and health of Canadians.

Asylum claimants face a rigorous process to determine whether or not they have a legitimate claim according to Canadian and international laws. Our rules-based system will determine the validity of your claim.

You’ll be removed from Canada if you don’t have a legitimate claim, or are not eligible to make a claim in Canada.

## **Resettle in Canada as a refugee**

How to be referred as a refugee so you can come to Canada, types of refugees, and the role of the United Nations Refugee Agency.

**How to be resettled in Canada as a refugee**

Final del formulario

**Who is eligible**

To come to Canada as a refugee, you must be referred. The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), a designated referral organization, or a private sponsorship group can refer you. You cannot apply directly to us as a refugee.

To be referred, you must fall into one of these two refugee classes.

**1) Convention refugee abroad class**

You may be in this class if you:

- are outside your home country,
- cannot return there due to a well-founded fear of persecution based on
  - race
  - religion
  - political opinion
  - nationality, or
  - membership in a particular social group. Examples: gender, sexual orientation, etc.

Convention refugees can be sponsored by:

- the Government of Canada ([government-assisted refugees](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-outside-canada/government-assisted-refugee-program.html)),
- a group of people or an organization ([privately sponsored refugees](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-outside-canada/private-sponsorship-program/refugees-information.html)), or
- a mix of both ([blended visa office-referred refugees](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-outside-canada/private-sponsorship-program/blended-visa-office-program.html)).

You can also be a Convention refugee if you have the funds needed to support yourself and your family after you arrive in Canada. You will still need the UNHCR, a referral organization, or a private sponsorship group to refer you.

**2) Country of asylum class**

You may be in this class if you:

- are outside your home country, or the country where you normally live, and
- have been seriously affected by civil war or armed conflict, or
- have been denied basic human rights on an ongoing basis.

Country of asylum class refugees can be privately sponsored. You can also be in this class if you have the funds you need to support yourself and your family after you arrive in Canada. You will still need the UNHCR, a referral organization, or a private sponsorship group to refer you.

**How to apply**

If you are referred, you will need to fill out the application package to [apply as a Convention refugee or as a humanitarian-protected person abroad](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/applying-convention-refugee-humanitarian-protected-person-abroad.html). You will need to pass a [medical exam](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams.html) and [security and criminal check](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/police-certificates.html).

Note: The province of Quebec selects its own refugees. Find out about [Quebec’s procedures for selecting refugees abroad](http://www.immigration-quebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/immigrate-settle/refugees-other/refugee-selected/selection.html).

**Who is not eligible?**

You are not eligible if:

- you have another stable option for protection, such as an offer to be resettled in another country,
- you become a citizen of another country, which will then protect you,
- you choose to return to the country you left, or
- the reasons you left your country no longer exist.

## **Government-Assisted Refugees program**

Through the Government-Assisted Refugees (GAR) program, refugees are referred to Canada for resettlement by

- the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) or
- another referral organization

You **can’t apply** to resettle in Canada as a government-assisted refugee. Instead, we rely on referral organizations like the UNHCR to help us reach the people who need resettlement.

To be considered by a referral organization, you must register for refugee status with the UNHCR or state authorities.

**Features**

As a government-assisted refugee, either the Government of Canada or the [province of Quebec](https://www.quebec.ca/en/immigration/refugees-asylum-seekers/refugees-abroad/government-assisted-refugees) will support you while you settle in Canada. This support is delivered by non-governmental agencies that we fund, called service provider organizations.

You’ll [receive support](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-within-canada/government-assisted-refugee-program.html)

- for up to 1 year from the date you arrive in Canada or
- until you’re able to support yourself (whichever happens first)

**Human rights defenders stream**

We created a refugee stream for human rights defenders under the GAR program. Through this new stream, we’ll resettle up to 250 people (human rights defenders and their family members) each year.

We’ll resettle human rights defenders to Canada in the same way that we resettle other government-assisted refugees.

You can’t apply to resettle in Canada under this stream. The UNHCR refers human rights defenders to us. [Front Line Defenders](https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/canada-program) and [ProtectDefenders.eu](https://protectdefenders.eu/) help the UNHCR identify the people who are most in need of protection through this stream.

**What happens next**

If you’re referred to us for resettlement in Canada as a government-assisted refugee, you can learn more about

1. what happens [after your case has been referred](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-outside-canada/government-assisted-refugee-program/after-approved-next-steps.html)
2. [how long it takes to process government-assisted refugee cases](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html)
3. what you can expect when you [arrive in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-outside-canada/after-apply-next-steps/prepare-arrival.html)

**After you apply: Refugee status from outside Canada**

A Canadian visa office will process your application. Most visa offices follow similar steps to process applications (see the information below). However, there may be some differences from one office to another.

**Letter of confirmation**

After you submit your application, the visa office will send you a letter to confirm it received the application. Your file number will be at the top of the letter. Make sure you include your file number if you contact Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) about your case for any reason.

**Application assessment process**

A visa officer will check to see that you included everything needed with your application. The officer will make sure that you completed your application forms correctly and included the proper supporting documents.

Most applicants will be asked to attend a personal interview. If an interview is required, the visa office will contact you and give you information about the time and place of the interview. Your dependants may be asked to attend as well.

You should be prepared to tell the visa officer why you consider yourself a refugee. The officer will ask you questions to assess your situation.

When you attend the interview, bring any documents related to your case and that may help the visa officer establish your identity and support your claim.

**Collection of biometric information**

As of November 2014, IRCC began collecting biometric information from persons seeking refugee status from outside Canada. There is no additional fee for this collection.

At your interview, or during another in-person interaction with the visa office, you may be asked to provide your biometric information. Biometric information is defined as a digital photograph and all available fingerprints. Applicants who are under 14 years old, or 80 years old and over, may not be asked to provide biometric information.

Giving your fingerprints and photograph is a safe, fast, and clean process that only takes about five minutes to complete. An IRCC officer, or locally-engaged staff working under the supervision of an IRCC officer, will take a digital photograph of your face and ask you to put your fingers on a glass screen to be scanned.

When you arrive in Canada, a CBSA border services officer may use your biometrics to verify that you are the same person approved for resettlement.

Your fingerprints, photograph, and the personal information you gave in your application will be handled in line with Canada’s privacy laws.

Your personal information will be kept safe. Your biometric information will be encrypted and sent by a secure connection to the Government of Canada and stored in a secure database. It will then be deleted from the computer system used to collect it.

**Processing time**

[Processing times](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html) vary depending on the visa office where you applied.

You may be able to speed up the process if you:

- make sure you include all the information needed with your application
- validate the _Generic Application Form for Canada_ \[IMM 0008\] online, and printing and including the barcode page with your application
- notify the visa office if information on your application changes
- don’t call the visa office if you don’t need to
- make sure the photocopies and documents you provide are clear and easy to read and
- provide certified English or French translations of documents, where needed.

Your application will take longer if the visa office has to take extra steps to assess your case. This can happen if:

- you do not sign or fully complete your application forms
- documents are missing, or if you do not give a good explanation of why documents are not included
- there are criminal or security problems with your application
- you do not include a certified English or French translation, if asked to
- there are problems verifying the information and documents you provided
- you need more tests or consultations for a medical condition you have
- your family situation is not clear for reasons like a divorce, adoption or child custody case that hasn’t been resolved
- the local visa office has to consult with other IRCC offices in Canada or abroad or
- there is not enough postage on your application.

You can [check the status of your application online](https://services3.cic.gc.ca/ecas/security.do?lang=en)

**Medical examinations**

You must pass a medical examination before coming to Canada. Your dependants must also pass a medical examination, even if they are not coming with you.

Applications for permanent residence will not be approved if your health is a danger to public health or safety.

Instructions on how to take the [medical exam](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams.html) will be sent to you after you send in your application.

**Criminal and security checks**

If you have a criminal record, you may not be allowed to enter Canada and your permanent residence application may be refused. People who pose a risk to Canada’s security are also not allowed to enter the country.

If you want to immigrate to Canada, you and any family members 18 years of age and older who come with you must have [criminal and security checks](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/police-certificates.html).

**Change of address**

If you move or change your address, telephone number or any other contact information after you apply, you must notify IRCC. Contact the visa office where you applied.

**The decision on your application**

If your application is successful, IRCC will issue a permanent resident visa and a Confirmation of Permanent Residence (COPR) to you. Your COPR will include identification information as well as your photograph and signature. You must have your COPR and your visa with you when you arrive in Canada.

If your application is refused, the decision will not be revised, but you may complete a new application.

**Medical services before you travel**

Some medical services you need before you leave for Canada are covered by the Interim Federal Health Program. This includes things like medical exams and services you may need for safe travel to Canada. Find out [who is eligible and how it works](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-outside-canada/health-care.html).

**Travelling to Canada**

If you are selected to resettle to Canada, IRCC may give you a [loan](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-within-canada/financial.html#loansProgram) to pay for airfare or, in highly exceptional cases, grant you the money. IRCC will book your passage. If you do not have a passport, IRCC will help you obtain travel documents to allow you to come to Canada.

If you do not have a passport, you will need either an International Committee of the Red Cross travel document or a Single-Journey Travel Document. The Single-Journey Travel Document is issued by IRCC.

The visa office where you submit your application will give you information about travelling to Canada.

When you arrive in Canada, an officer from the [Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)](http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/noncan-eng.html) will meet you. The CBSA secures the borders and ports of entry to Canada.

You must have a valid travel document (for example, a passport or a travel document issued by the Government of Canada). You must also have a Canadian permanent resident visa with you.

The officer will ask to see your passport from your home country, if you have one, and other travel documents. Make sure you have them on hand. This will help speed up your entry into Canada.

The officer will make sure that your permanent resident visa is still valid. The expiry date is shown on the visa. You cannot use it after it expires. We cannot extend permanent resident visas. Make sure you use it within the time limit.

The officer will give you your Confirmation of Permanent Residence (COPR). You must sign your COPR.

The officer will ask you a few questions. The questions will be similar to the ones you answered on your Application for Permanent Residence in Canada. The officer will confirm that you are eligible to enter Canada.

The officer may not allow you to enter Canada if you give false or incomplete information at the point of entry, or if you do not satisfy the officer that you are eligible to enter Canada.

If there are no problems at the port of entry, the officer will authorize you to enter Canada as a permanent resident. We will mail your permanent resident card to your new address in Canada.

You should make sure that the Canadian address on your COPR card is correct because we will send your permanent resident card to that address. If you plan to change your address in the future, or if you do not have a permanent address yet, give us the correct address as soon as you can.

**Disclosure of funds**

If you arrive in Canada with more than CAN$10,000, you must tell the CBSA officer. If you do not, you could be fined, and your funds could be seized. These funds could be in the form of:

- cash,
- securities that belong to you (for example, stocks, bonds, debentures or treasury bills), or
- bank drafts, cheques, traveller’s cheques, or money orders.

**What you can bring to Canada**

You can find customs and border information on the [CBSA website](http://cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/noncan-eng.html).

**Help after you arrive**

After you have been admitted to Canada, someone from a settlement organization or sponsorship group will meet you at the airport. They will bring you to a place where you will stay for the first few days. They will also help you to find a permanent place to live.

Once in Canada, there are services to help you learn English and French, find a job or other daily activities. Find out more [about services in your area](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/newcomers/services/index.asp).
