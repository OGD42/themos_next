**2\. Submit your application**

**Before you submit your application, make sure you:**

- answer all questions on the forms
- electronically sign your application (type your full name exactly as shown on your passport)
- upload all supporting documents

If you submit an incomplete application, we won’t process it. We’ll return it to you and you’ll have to reapply.

Once you’ve completed your application, we’ll review it.

**After you apply**

**included:**

- we’ll email you (or your [representative](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigration-citizenship-representative/learn-about-representatives.html)) an **acknowledgement of receipt** (AOR) with your application number
- this confirms we added your application to our system

**If any forms are not signed or are missing**:

- we’ll return your application without processing it
- we won’t add your application to our system and you won’t get an AOR

**Checking your application status**

You can [check your status](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-status.html) once we’ve started processing your application and sent you the application number. To do so:

- create an IRCC secure online account and [link your application to it](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/account/link-paper-online.html)
  - This includes an application submitted online through the Permanent Residence Portal or an alternate format, if you’re eligible.
- use the [online status tool](https://services3.cic.gc.ca/ecas/security.do?app=ecas&lang=en), which is updated daily

**Stage 2: We review if you’re eligible and admissible to Canada**

If your application is complete, we’ll start processing it.

**Processing your application**

You may need to go to an interview to give us more information. Any family members coming with you to Canada may also need to do this.

If we ask you to come for an interview, we’ll tell you the date, time, where it is, and what documents to bring with you. You and your family members must give your fingerprints and photo ([biometrics](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/campaigns/biometrics/facts.html)) at this interview.

**Admissibility to Canada**

Once we confirm you’re eligible, we’ll review your application to make sure you’re admissible to Canada. This means we’ll check to make sure you pass:

- security checks
- criminality checks
- medical checks

As part of the medical check, you and any family members coming with you to Canada must have [immigration medical exams](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-permanent-residents.html).

**You should only do your medical exams when we ask you to**. When we ask you to have your exams, we’ll send you:

- medical forms for you and any family members in your application
- instructions to find a doctor in your area who is authorized to do your medical exam

The fees for your medical exam will be covered by [your temporary medical insurance](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/help-within-canada/health-care/interim-federal-health-program/services.html) only if you’re still outside Canada. (This is called the Interim Federal Health Program \[IFHP\]. It’s part of the pre-departure medical services you’re eligible for.)

At your medical exam, you can also talk to your doctor about other medical services that will help support your travel to Canada. This can include routine, voluntary vaccinations and some other medical services.

You’ll get a document that shows you’re eligible for these services. You need to show it to your doctor to confirm your coverage.

To access a doctor who will accept your IFHP coverage:

- go to [our online tool to search for doctors](https://secure.cic.gc.ca/pp-md/pp-list.aspx) near you
- look for the note “This panel physician or clinic provides services paid by Interim Federal Health Program”

**Reasons your application could be delayed**

Your application could be delayed if:

- your contact information is missing or out of date
- your application is not complete
- the documents you send us
  - are unclear or don’t meet requirements
  - don’t have a certified English or French translation

- your family situation isn’t clear, or has changed and you didn’t let us know, which could include
  - a divorce

- the processing office has to contact other IRCC offices in or outside Canada to confirm details you gave us
- you don’t include your application number when you contact us
- there are any issues getting an exit permit for the country you’re living in

**If we approve your application**

If we approve your application:

- You must pay the costs of your travel to Canada. To cover these costs, you can access our [transportation loan](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/immigration-loans-program/procedures-transportation.html) using IOM’s travel booking assistance.
- The IOM charges a fee of $300 CAD per person for this service. These costs will be added to your transportation loan.
- IOM’s travel booking assistance includes:
  - helping you apply for exit permits (and, in some cases, apply to waive exit fees)
  - arranging transportation and housing when you need to go to a government office for an exit permit
  - getting travel documents for transiting countries and entering Canada
  - finalizing your transportation loan
  - arranging transportation, housing and meal allowances for all your travel – from where you’re living to the departure point in your current country, and onward to Canada
  - making sure the most direct route is taken, using a Canadian carrier or reliable non-Canadian carrier that has signed an agreement to provide reduced migrant fares
  - arranging an escort for travel when needed (if we pre-approve this)
  - helping if the unexpected happens during travel

If you checked the box in Schedule 1 \[IMM 5989\] saying that you’d like to access services from the International Organization for Migration (IOM):

- they’ll help arrange your transportation to Canada
- you can access IRCC’s interest-free transportation loan
- we’ll let the IOM know
  - They’ll contact you directly with more information.

**Getting your permanent resident status**

If we approve your application, we’ll issue you (and any of your family members that are coming with you):

- a visa for travel to Canada **or** a single journey travel document that will let you travel to Canada (if you don’t have a valid passport), and
- a confirmation of permanent residence (COPR)

If the country you live in requires you to get an exit permit, you must apply for it before you can leave for Canada.

**Arriving in Canada**

**Before you arrive in Canada**

Before you come to Canada, you’ll be eligible for free pre-arrival settlement services to help you learn about living and working in Canada. These services:

- include information about life in Canada
- include an employment skills assessment

- are available in English and French, as well as Haitian Creole and Spanish

**After you arrive in Canada**

**Financial assistance**

After you get to Canada, you'll be eligible for a one-time lump sum payment to help you cover costs to establish yourself and your family in Canada.

We’ll send you instructions on how to access this financial assistance. You’ll need to set up a bank account in Canada.

Use the [web form](https://services3.cic.gc.ca/ecas/?app=coanotify&lang=en) if you need to update your contact information or tell us about changes to your family situation (for example, marriage, birth, divorce or death).

**Get your permanent resident card**

We’ll mail your permanent resident (PR) card to your address in Canada.

If you didn’t give us your Canadian mailing address when you became a permanent resident:

- use our [online address notification tool](https://services3.cic.gc.ca/ecas/?app=coanotify&lang=en) to send it to us
- you must give us your address within 180 days of the day you become a permanent resident
  - If you don’t send it within 180 days, we’ll cancel the PR card and you’ll have to [apply for another one](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card/apply-renew-replace.html) (and pay new processing fees).
