# **Atlantic Immigration Program**

The Atlantic Immigration Program is a pathway to permanent residence for skilled foreign workers and international graduates from a Canadian institution who want to work and live in 1 of Canada’s 4 Atlantic provinces—New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island or Newfoundland and Labrador. The program helps employers hire qualified candidates for jobs they haven’t been able to fill locally.

The Atlantic Immigration Program replaced the Atlantic Immigration Pilot. You can now submit your permanent residence application to the program.

## **Hire through the Atlantic Immigration Program: How the program works for employers**

#### **About the program**
The Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP) helps you hire qualified candidates for jobs you haven’t been able to fill locally. These candidates can be overseas or living in Canada as temporary residents.

Before you can make a job offer to a candidate, you must first [become designated by the provincial government](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/hire-immigrant/get-designated.html) of the Atlantic province where the candidate will be working.

Once you’ve offered a job and the candidate has accepted, there are several steps that you and the candidate need to complete. If you and the candidate meet all the requirements, the candidate may then apply for [permanent resident status in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-card/understand-pr-status.html).

We’ll help you through this process by providing various [resources](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/hire-immigrant/employer-resources.html), such as training and services offered by the Dedicated Service Channel.

#### Get designated
#### About the designation
Before you can make a job offer to hire a candidate, you must first become designated by the provincial government of the Atlantic province where the candidate will be working.

Being “designated” means you can hire candidates under the Atlantic Immigration Program. The provinces are responsible for designating employers.

To be designated, your organization must

- not be in violation of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) or the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)
- be in [good standing](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/hire-immigrant/get-designated.html#centred-popup) and comply with employment standards and occupational health and safety legislation
- not recruit or hire workers for the purpose of establishing a pool of candidates that can be later transferred or contracted out to separate businesses for staffing purposes
- have been in continuous, active operation under the same management for at least 2 years in 1 of the Atlantic provinces, or be able to show continuous, active operation in another location with confirmation of approval from the province in which you’re applying for designation
- work with a settlement service provider organization to help your candidates get settlement services
- complete the free [onboarding training](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/hire-immigrant/employer-training.html#onboarding)
- complete the free [intercultural competency training](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/hire-immigrant/employer-training.html#intercultural), unless you’re exempted by the province

#### Apply to the province to become designated
Each province has its own application process. **There is no cost to become a designated employer. **You can find applications to become designated on the provinces’ websites:
- [New Brunswick](https://www.welcomenb.ca/content/wel-bien/en/atlantic-immigration-program.html)
- [Newfoundland and Labrador](https://www.gov.nl.ca/immigration/)
- [Nova Scotia](https://novascotiaimmigration.com/)
- [Prince Edward Island](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en)

The provinces are responsible for designating employers. Contact the provinces directly for any questions about the designation process.

Things to remember about designation:
- You only have to apply once to be designated by a province. You don’t need to apply for each candidate.
- You can apply for designation even before you find a candidate.
- You must be designated in the province where the candidate will be working. If the candidate will be working in several provinces, you must be designated in all those provinces.
- You can’t hire a candidate under the Atlantic Immigration Program if they won’t be working in an Atlantic province.

Once you’re designated, you’ll receive a **Confirmation of Designation** from the province.

#### Take your required training
To become a designated employer, you must complete these 2 training courses before you apply for designation with the province:
- [onboarding training](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/hire-immigrant/employer-training.html#onboarding)
- [intercultural competency training](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/hire-immigrant/employer-training.html#intercultural)

These courses will help you with the different steps you need to follow in the Atlantic Immigration Program.

#### Online onboarding training
Once you [sign up](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/hire-immigrant/employer-training.html#signup), we’ll send you a training video to watch at your own pace. You must complete this training before applying for designation with the province. You’ll need to attest that you watched the full video when you submit your designation application to the province.

The training covers the following:
- Introduction to Canada’s immigration system

#### Find a candidate
When you’re designated, you can hire skilled workers and international students who have graduated from a recognized post-secondary institution in Atlantic Canada.

#### The Atlantic Immigration Program doesn’t match candidates with jobs.
You may find a candidate on your own or a candidate may approach you.

#### Meet the requirements
#### National Occupational Classification 2021
On November 16, 2022, we switched to [the 2021 version of the National Occupational Classification (NOC)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/find-national-occupation-code.html).

Use the [NOC 2016 page](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/hire-immigrant/requirements/noc-2016.html) if you applied for a job offer **on or before November 15, 2022**.

**Make sure the job offer and the candidate meet the program requirements**

The Atlantic Immigration Program has its own requirements for hiring candidates. You must ensure your [job offer](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/hire-immigrant/requirements.html#offer) and the [candidates](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/hire-immigrant/requirements.html#candidates) meet all the requirements of the program.

Job offer requirements
As an employer, you must ensure that the job you’re offering is
- full time
- [non-seasonal](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#non_seasonal_work)
- at least 1 year in duration (1 year from the time the candidate becomes a permanent resident) if you’re offering a [NOC 2021 TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/find-national-occupation-code-2021.html) category job
- a permanent position if you’re offering a [NOC 2021 TEER 4 category](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/find-national-occupation-code-2021.html) job
- at the same skill level as, or higher than, the work experience that qualifies the candidate for the position (refer to the table below), unless they are an international student who has graduated from a [recognized post-secondary institution in Atlantic Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/post-secondary-institutions.html)
    - For certain health care sector occupations, you don’t need to have a job offer at the same skill level as, or higher than, the qualifying work experience.
        - Work experience in NOC 32101 (licensed practical nurses) and NOC 31301 (registered nurses) can be used as qualifying work experience if you have a job offer in NOC 33102 (nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates) or NOC 44101 (home health care workers).

#### Encourage candidates to get their documents ready
Candidates will need to include specific documents with their permanent residence application. Encourage your candidate to start getting these documents ready even **before** you make the job offer, because some of these documents take time to get. Documents include:
- results of a [language test](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/language-testing.html) showing they can communicate in English or French
- an [educational credential assessment report](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/education-assessment.html), which shows how their education compares to a Canadian credential, if the candidate studied outside Canada
- proof of [work experience](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/how-to-immigrate/eligibility.html#work_experience), except for candidates who are international students who have graduated from a recognized post-secondary institution in Atlantic Canada
- [proof that they have enough money](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/proof-funds.html) to support themselves and their family

#### Make a job offer
When you have a candidate and a job that meet the program’s requirements, offer the candidate the job using the form [Offer of Employment to a Foreign National [IMM 0157] (PDF, 317 KB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/kits/forms/imm0157e.pdf).

If the job offer is permanent you must enter permanent as the end date in box 22 of your Offer of Employment form (IMM 0157).

Complete and sign the form. Give the candidate a copy for them to sign and submit with their application. The candidate will need a copy of the form and a copy of your Confirmation of Designation to get a settlement plan.

Settlement plan

You need to work with a [settlement service provider organization](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/settlement-service-provider-organizations.html) in your province to support your newcomer employee(s) and their family.
- If the candidate lives outside of Canada, refer them to [organizations that can help them get prepared for their move to Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/settlement-service-provider-organizations.html#outside).
- If the candidate is living in your community, refer them to [an organization near you](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/settlement-service-provider-organizations.html#inside).
- If your candidate prefers French as an official language, refer them to a [Francophone organization](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/settlement-service-provider-organizations.html) who can help them in French, including [ConnexionsFrancophones.ca](www.connexionsfrancophones.ca/) (in French only), a one-stop shop for pre-arrival services.

These organizations can provide your candidate a needs and assets assessment, and then their settlement plan. The candidate will give you a copy of the settlement plan. You’ll need the plan to get endorsed.

#### Submit an endorsement application to the province
The province must endorse your job offer before the candidate can apply for permanent residence.

The provinces are responsible for the endorsement process. If you have any questions about the endorsement process, contact the province.

Visit the province’s website to get their endorsement application:
- [New Brunswick](https://www.welcomenb.ca/content/wel-bien/en/atlantic-immigration-program.html)
- [Newfoundland and Labrador](https://www.gov.nl.ca/immigration/)
- [Nova Scotia](https://novascotiaimmigration.com/)
- [Prince Edward Island](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/topic/office-immigration)

The endorsement application requires you to
- show that you haven’t been able to fill the job with someone locally
    - You **don’t** need a [labour market impact assessment](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#l)
- show that the job offer meets the program requirements
- send the completed and signed [Offer of Employment to a Foreign National [IMM 0157] (PDF, 317 KB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/kits/forms/imm0157e.pdf) to the candidate for their signature
    - The candidate will have to submit this form with their permanent residence application.
- include the settlement plan for the candidate and their accompanying family members

If the candidate is applying for a [work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/hire-immigrant/temporary-work-permit.html):
- you must request a referral letter from the provincial government when you’re applying for endorsement
- the candidate needs to include the referral letter in their application for a temporary work permit

The provincial endorsement application forms will tell you how to provide this information. The province may also ask for additional documentation.

If the province endorses the job offer, they’ll send a Certificate of Endorsement to the candidate. Once the candidate gets their endorsement certificate, they can apply for permanent residence.

After your first endorsement, the province will refer you to the [Dedicated Service Channel](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/hire-immigrant/employer-resources.html) to help you as a designated employer of the program.

#### Temporary work permit
**Optional: referral letter for temporary work permit**

Candidates who meet the requirements to apply for permanent residence may be eligible to apply for a temporary work permit.

This work permit lets the candidate begin working while their permanent residence application is being processed.

The work permit
- is only for the Atlantic Immigration Program
- is valid for 2 years
- is employer-specific, meaning the candidate can only work for you

In order for the candidate to apply for a work permit, you must request a referral letter from the provincial government when you’re applying for endorsement. The candidate will include the referral letter in their application for a temporary work permit.

Getting a temporary work permit doesn’t guarantee that we’ll approve the candidate’s permanent residence application.

Candidates applying for a temporary work permit will need to show that they meet the requirements for:
- [language](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/how-to-immigrate/eligibility.html#language_requirements)
- [education](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/how-to-immigrate/eligibility.html#educational_requirements)
- [work experience](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/how-to-immigrate/eligibility.html#work_experience)

International students who have graduated from a recognized post-secondary institution in Atlantic Canada are exempt from meeting the work requirements. All other candidates must meet the work experience requirements.

#### Resources for designated employers
As a designated employer, these resources will:
- help you guide your candidates during the application process
- help candidates get settled in Canada
- work towards creating a welcoming workplace

Dedicated Service Channel
